[Episode 4]

3
00:00:49,267 --> 00:00:52,967
The kindergarten class is
about to start, you know?

4
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:54,067
When will it end?

5
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:56,100
It should take about two hours.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,367
Dong Min! Jeon Dong Min!

7
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,500
Of course.

8
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,967
Of course, Teacher.

9
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:13,133
- Principal.
- Yes.

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,000
Lying itself isn't bad.

11
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:23,833
As long as you don't get caught.

12
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:27,300
Of course, Madam.

13
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,033
Madam?

14
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,967
Principal.

15
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:38,400
What did you just say?

16
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,333
What, Dong Min?

17
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,367
Who is Madam?

18
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:49,000
You mean Ms. Bu Se Mi?

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,967
Huh? What?

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,033
Ms. Bu Se Mi?

21
00:01:58,067 --> 00:01:59,933
Madam?

22
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:03,333
Madam, yes. Oh, my.

23
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,933
Our church's pastor's wife. Shh!

24
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:06,800
I'm sorry, Madam.

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,633
Oh, yes, just a moment...

26
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:11,300
Dong Min, yes.

27
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,333
Yes, I mean, exactly.

28
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,967
Yes, Madam. I'll see you on Sunday then.

29
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:20,667
Yes. Amen.

30
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:22,267
Okay.

31
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:25,300
Ugh.

32
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:29,833
Dong Min, why did you come here all of a sudden?

33
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,733
You called my name.

34
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:33,133
Don't you remember?

35
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:35,467
Did I call your name?

36
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:37,267
<i>Dong Min, Jeon Dong Min!</i>

37
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:38,867
<i>Oh, my.</i>

38
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:42,867
I...

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,733
called your name.

40
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:55,667
Lately, my memory's been so bad.

41
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,167
Dong Min!

42
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,933
It's almost time for the shuttle bus to arrive!

43
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,833
What?

44
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,033
Wait, you called about the shuttle bus
that's always coming?

45
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:11,433
Dong Min, today's a special day.

46
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:13,600
Ms. Bu Se Mi's first day at work!

47
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,667
We need to welcome the children specially.

48
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:17,433
Hurry, go out

49
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:20,267
and please give them a special welcome.

50
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,933
Hurry, Mister.

51
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:24,133
Sorry, Miss.

52
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:25,767
Shh.

53
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:32,600
Is eavesdropping your hobby?

54
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,100
No, I was just leaving.

55
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:50,500
Admiring...

56
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,133
Our beloved Ms. Bu Se Mi!

57
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,500
You're really meticulous.

58
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,833
Then, shall we finish the conversation
we were having earlier?

59
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:03,467
Let's do that.

60
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:07,400
Please don't make any mistakes
with titles from now on.

61
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,467
Of course, of course!

62
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:11,500
Teacher Bu Se Mi.

63
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,433
Good.

64
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:17,800
About the 300 million you promised earlier.

65
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,400
It should be manageable
for acquiring the kindergarten.

66
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,833
As you can see, it's rural here,
so prices aren't high.

67
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,133
300 million?

68
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:26,867
Yes.

69
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,900
I did mention three months.

70
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:35,267
Oh dear, just my share was 300 million?

71
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:37,467
Don't worry.

72
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:39,900
I'll settle it as soon as this job is done.

73
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,633
Oh, you tease!

74
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:46,033
Oh, you're being mischievous.

75
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,333
A verbal contract is valid,
but for things like this,

76
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:58,733
it's always more proper
to have it in writing, right?

77
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,967
You really do seem like
Attorney Lee's older sister.

78
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,833
I'll let the attorney know.

79
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,633
Well, if it's about our money...

80
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:12,300
Even our Lord would forgive this kind of lie.

81
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:15,300
Lying itself isn't bad, you know?

82
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,400
As long as you don't get caught.

83
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:21,300
That's quite a quote.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,433
Would you like to grab a coffee?

00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:28,900
[KE Communications]

86
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,067
What are they doing?

87
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:33,600
Looks like there's an internet issue?

88
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,867
Tae Min, you notice things like that now?

89
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:40,800
He's wearing a telecom company vest.

90
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,033
Can't you see? Are you getting presbyopia already?

91
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:44,800
Hey, come on!

92
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:50,633
Madam.

93
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,833
The information I'm about to share

94
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:59,367
is known only to you in Muchang,
Principal Lee Mi Seon.

95
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:03,833
But why are you telling me this in such detail?

96
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,800
If anyone in Muchang

97
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,767
discovers I'm Kim Yeong Ran, not Bu Se Mi,

98
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:11,267
and learns my personal information,

99
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:14,900
it means you leaked it, Principal Lee Mi Seon.

100
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,700
So, please keep this absolutely
confidential from now on.

101
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:29,600
Then

102
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:33,167
your real education...

103
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:36,333
You didn't actually graduate
from Iseon Women's University, did you?

104
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,433
No, I only finished high school.

105
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:40,667
I passed the GED for middle and high school.

106
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,867
Took the middle school equivalency test
at juvenile detention.

107
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,400
Juvenile detention?

108
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,267
I stole sanitary pads.

109
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:53,900
Oh, dear.

110
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,600
You've had such misfortune.

111
00:06:58,267 --> 00:07:00,400
Then these family records must all be...

112
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,800
They're fake.

113
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,133
I don't know who my father is.
I only have my mother.

114
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,100
She has three criminal convictions.

115
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:10,800
Oh, my. Oh, my.

116
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,900
So your mother has a record too.

117
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:24,233
It's probably easier to find what's true
than what's false, right?

118
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:26,600
At least my Class-1 driver's license is real.

119
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,067
Well, then this isn't completely fake, is it?

120
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:31,867
If you want to know more about me,

121
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:34,867
just search the news articles, plenty of them.

122
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:39,733
But, you know the media always exaggerates.

123
00:07:39,733 --> 00:07:41,333
Stuff like calling you a 'gold digger',

124
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,367
that's not all true, right?

125
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:47,167
Everything except the 'gold digger' part
is basically true.

126
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:51,067
Oh, so most of it's true.

127
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,400
- Principal.
- Yes?

128
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,833
What should I do now?

129
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,333
Well, then...

130
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,267
Oh! Could you head over first?

131
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:06,033
I'll follow shortly.

132
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:08,333
You can leave your bag here.

133
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:11,167
Muchang is a safe place.

134
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,367
By the way, Miss...

135
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,700
You and our Don aren't involved
in anything, right?

136
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:26,833
I'm not into guys like Attorney Lee.

137
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,900
What? Huh?

138
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,700
Wait, that somehow feels insulting.

139
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:41,967
'Just not my type.' Pfft.

140
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,900
Ugh, really.

141
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,800
Cams in the classroom.

142
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
But not in the hallway.

143
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,633
What are you doing?

144
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,767
Aren't kindergartens required to have CCTV?

145
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:16,733
Huh?

146
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:19,567
Daycares are required to have it,

147
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:21,867
but kindergartens aren't.

148
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:24,267
You didn't know?

149
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:27,600
My previous kindergarten had cameras everywhere.

150
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
There's a call.

151
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,433
- Yes.
<i>- Installation's complete.</i>

152
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:37,200
<i>I've sent you a link.</i>

153
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,300
<i>Install it to monitor from your phone
or laptop anytime.</i>

154
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,333
Good work.

155
00:09:46,467 --> 00:09:49,400
[Would you like to open the link?]

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,900
Why are you staring?

157
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,333
- Mi Seon.
- Huh?

158
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,367
Is Ms. Bu Se Mi...

159
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:07,700
She's pretty, right?
You can't take your eyes off her.

160
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,267
Not that much.

161
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:11,100
I get it, Dong Min.

162
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,833
But don't you dare make a move. Ever.

163
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:19,100
With her credentials and looks,
you think she's single?

164
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,867
Bet her boyfriend's loaded too.

165
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:24,800
How'd you know that?

166
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,167
Of course. I know that.

167
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,500
I can tell at a glance.

168
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,600
Birds of a feather, you know?

169
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,833
Mi Seon, about Ms. Bu Se Mi,

170
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,533
you did properly verify her education
and background, right?

171
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:40,000
I personally called Iseon Kindergarten
to confirm everything.

172
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,500
Resumes don't show character
or compatibility, right?

173
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,800
What, you live in deception?

174
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,367
I just don't want the kids hurt.

175
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:47,100
You should care more about this as principal.

176
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,933
Then, this time, I'll pay extra attention.

177
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:54,700
So stop suspecting everything, okay? Please?

178
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,900
Oh, hello.

179
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,300
[Order]
Hello.

180
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,100
- Hello.
- Hi.

181
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,700
- Slowly. Shoes in place.
- Take your time.

182
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,767
Good.

183
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:12,800
- Hello.
- You're here.

184
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:24,233
What brings you here?

185
00:11:26,467 --> 00:11:28,267
To file a missing person report.

186
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,267
How old is the person?

187
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:33,167
Any dementia or chronic illness?

188
00:11:34,633 --> 00:11:35,933
Twenty-nine this year?

189
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:37,633
Twenty-nine...

190
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,400
What? Are you joking?

191
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,933
My father remarried.

192
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:47,900
Even if you report an adult missing,

193
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,667
we can't search without proof of endangerment.

194
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:51,933
And even if we find her,

195
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:55,767
we can't disclose contact info if she refuses.

196
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:59,767
So, I might never find my mother?

197
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:05,967
Even when an adult is missing,
their personal decision is important.

198
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:08,900
Isn't your mother more likely hiding

199
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,300
than missing?

200
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,167
Detective, you're really not understanding me.

201
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,833
Pardon?

202
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,433
Yes, this is Sergeant Kim Hak Su.

203
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:19,800
Yes, Team Leader.

204
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,900
Yes, yes.

205
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,533
What? The chief called you?

206
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:27,467
Ah, yes, understood.

207
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,433
Though she's an adult,
there's sufficient reason to believe you.

208
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:36,100
We'll file a missing person report.

209
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,233
We'll conduct a nationwide search
and investigate the disappearance.

210
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,633
Finally, you understand.

211
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:56,300
You're new here.

212
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,167
Who introduced you?

213
00:12:58,167 --> 00:12:59,867
Someone named Kim So Yeong.

214
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:01,700
Kim So Yeong?

215
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,067
That's a common name.

216
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,567
I know at least three Kim So Yeongs myself.

217
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:10,833
Short So Yeong, Tall So Yeong, Chubby So Yeong.

218
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:14,000
But

219
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,333
the Kim So Yeong you did time with
for pyramid schemes, that one's not common, huh?

220
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,933
You know foot baths are great, right?

221
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:29,733
Raise your body temperature just one degree
and it prevents cancer and such.

222
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:32,700
Add this enzyme to a foot bath

223
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,433
and your skin becomes smooth and silky.

224
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:40,267
My mother suffered from diabetes for years.

225
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:44,867
No hospital in Korea could cure it,

226
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,367
but enzyme cured her.

227
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:50,467
Then please enjoy a foot bath before you leave.

228
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:52,167
How much is that?

229
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:55,800
Oh, sir! You've got a good eye.

230
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,367
I'm not the boss yet.

231
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:01,867
With that shiny forehead and prominent nose,

232
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:04,000
you're born to be a CEO.

233
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,933
This bottle costs 180,000 won.

234
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:09,667
Original production cost was over 300,000 won,

235
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:12,200
but we deal directly with Cambodian factories,

236
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,133
so we offer half price.

237
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:16,000
We're selling at barely 30,000 won profit,

238
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,133
practically giving it away.

239
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:22,900
Should we buy a hundred bottles?

240
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,567
A hundred?

241
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:26,267
That many?

242
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,333
How many installments would you like?

243
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,967
Forget installments.

244
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:38,567
I'll buy 100 bottles

245
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,567
if you tell me where Kim So Yeong is.

246
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:01,400
[18 million won]

247
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,033
[Kim So Yeong]

248
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,533
You called earlier?

249
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:26,167
Me? Just working like a dog, as usual.

250
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:29,200
Why? What's up?

251
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,900
A clean-cut guy's looking for me?

252
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,867
I've never even dated a 'clean-cut' man.

253
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:40,033
Hyeon Ok.

254
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:42,000
Did you tell them where I am?

255
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,267
Hey.

256
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:45,267
Don't you trust me?

257
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,700
Just warning you to be careful.

258
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,533
Got it.

259
00:15:52,867 --> 00:15:54,133
What, what, what?

260
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:55,700
Why don't you follow me to the toilet
while you're at it?

261
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,867
Oh, jeez, this.

262
00:15:57,867 --> 00:16:00,633
I saved yours but you disappeared.

263
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:02,067
Ah, hot.

264
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:04,433
Once it cools it's not as good.

265
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,333
Anyway, if someone looks for me,
pretend you don't know me.

266
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,667
Ugh, this place is just like jail.

267
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:16,067
A mutt's on my tail,
even following me to the bathroom.

268
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,533
I don't follow you when you poop, it smells.

269
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:20,600
Whoa, jeez...

270
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,233
Not talking about you.

271
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:25,133
Okay, talk again later.

272
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,300
People who say 'don't you trust me'
are never trustworthy.

273
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:39,433
Tasty.

274
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:40,800
Nice touch.

275
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,767
[Gaseong]

276
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:46,800
I'll handle your coffee from now on.

277
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,500
Suit yourself.

278
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:57,200
<i>Attorney, it's Byeol Nae.</i>

279
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,267
<i>Someone's looking for Kim So Yeong.</i>

280
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:01,533
<i>The caller is named Hyeon Ok.</i>

281
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:04,833
<i>Kim So Yeong says she can't be trusted.</i>

282
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,267
<i>They were prison mates,</i>

283
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:09,667
<i>but they only have each other.</i>

284
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,533
<i>Oh, Attorney,</i>

285
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:13,833
<i>and she called me a 'mutt'.</i>

286
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,833
<i>It seems Kim So Yeong</i>

287
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:19,600
<i>doesn't realize how smart mutts are.</i>

288
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,667
Facts, opinions, and plot twists all in one.

289
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:27,600
Her texts have hidden charm.

290
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,067
Oh! You scared me.

291
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,933
Sorry, did I startle you?

292
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:35,833
I did ballet as a child,

293
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:39,533
so I'm good at silent walking.

294
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,133
This vacuum is really quiet too, isn't it?

295
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:51,767
Of course, it's turned off.

296
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:53,867
Is anyone here normal?

297
00:17:53,867 --> 00:17:55,033
Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

298
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,067
Yes?

299
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:59,467
If you're done cleaning, get back to the annex.

300
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,933
Attorney Lee, did you make my toast too?

301
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:09,133
That's so touching.

302
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:10,533
Shall we eat together now?

303
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,633
I'm starving right now.

304
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,000
I'll eat all of this myself.

305
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,233
Oh, and,

306
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:18,720
I'm going out this afternoon,

307
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,300
so clean every corner before then.

308
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,567
There's too much dust in the corners.

309
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,800
Why is it so quiet?

310
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,800
Attorney Lee.

311
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,067
Attorney Lee.

312
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,333
Attorney Lee.

313
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:05,900
Strawberry Class!

314
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,700
- Yes!
- Oh.

315
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,333
Aren't they adorable?

316
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,767
The kids have so much energy,

317
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:15,733
so it takes time for them to calm down.

318
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,733
Principal!

319
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:19,433
Principal!

320
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:25,100
Oh, please come in.
I've been waiting, just a moment.

321
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:32,433
Actually, we had a meeting scheduled today
with the kindergarten supplies coordinator...

322
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:35,600
Miss!

323
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,867
Can you watch the kids for a bit? Just briefly!

324
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:40,300
Are you asking me to teach them?

325
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,867
It'll just be a short while, really quick!

326
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:44,567
You can read them a book or teach them a song,

327
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:45,900
do anything you want, anything.

328
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,667
- Wait here.
- Principal.

329
00:20:58,067 --> 00:21:01,100
Hello, children.

330
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,300
- Hello.
- Hello.

331
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,300
I'm Ms. Bu Se Mi, starting today

332
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,800
with the Strawberry Class.

333
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:14,067
Well, today's lesson will be...

334
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,733
- Miss!
- Yeah?

335
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,133
How long will you be staying here?

336
00:21:18,133 --> 00:21:20,667
You'll stay until Christmas, right?

337
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:23,833
We'll make a Christmas tree, right?

338
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:26,267
Well...

339
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:29,767
That's...

340
00:21:29,767 --> 00:21:31,400
Ju Won, what's that?

341
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,433
I've never seen that before.

342
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:34,833
Oh, Uncle Tae Min bought it for me.

343
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,733
Really? Let me play with it a bit.

344
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:40,033
Play with your own toy.

345
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:41,933
Just let me play with it.

346
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,200
No, play with your own.

347
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,033
- Ah!
- Hey, that's mine.

348
00:21:46,033 --> 00:21:47,233
Give it back!

349
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:49,367
- Kids, stop fighting.
- Fight.

350
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:51,867
- Children, no fighting.
- Fight.

351
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,500
Oh my goodness.

352
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,800
Kids! Quiet!

353
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:17,467
- Wow!
- Wow!

354
00:22:19,267 --> 00:22:21,167
Kids,

355
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:22,800
focus!

356
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,533
Sit down.

357
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,433
Children, have you heard of self-defense?

358
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:44,167
By age seven, you should know
how to protect yourselves.

359
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:47,233
That's what I believe.

360
00:22:47,233 --> 00:22:50,267
There are 30,000 child abuse cases annually,

361
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:54,233
with 38 children losing their lives.

362
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,867
Bad people

363
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:07,533
always target those weaker than them.

364
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:12,200
Understood?

365

Then, let's make befriending
Muchang residents part of the mission.

728
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:21,333
It seems Ga Seon Yeong filed
a missing person's report.

729
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:23,567
To survive three months in Muchang safely,

730
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:25,300
that would be wiser.

731
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,500
I'll call again later.

732
00:50:34,967 --> 00:50:36,967
What are you two doing here?

733
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,533
Ah, these are strawberries I grew.

734
00:50:39,533 --> 00:50:40,733
Try some.

735
00:50:40,733 --> 00:50:42,867
No, thanks. I don't like strawberries.

736
00:50:42,867 --> 00:50:44,667
But you said you liked them earlier...

737
00:50:47,233 --> 00:50:48,933
Ah, Miss.

738
00:50:48,933 --> 00:50:50,667
I know it because...

739
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:51,700
No, thanks.

740
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,167
Miss, want some makgeolli with these?

741
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:56,667
Strawberries and makgeolli are a heavenly combo.

742
00:50:56,667 --> 00:50:58,567
I can't handle alcohol well.

743
00:50:58,567 --> 00:51:00,567
You two enjoy yourselves.

744
00:51:11,767 --> 00:51:14,600
I won't get kicked out for three months.

745
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,533
Dong Min.

746
00:51:28,533 --> 00:51:31,833
I really admire women who take care of themselves.

747
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,633
Right.

748
00:51:35,633 --> 00:51:38,000
Just meet any woman, please.

749
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,733
But I don't...

750
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:46,400
- Dong Min.
- What?

751
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,967
Today your logic and your heart will collide.

752
00:51:48,967 --> 00:51:52,667
Whatever happens, don't lose your head. Got it?

753
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,100
Skip the horoscope today.

754
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,333
Pray for a strawberry harvest,
whether it's for the general or baby spirit.

755
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:02,433
Boss, does that count as a day's wage too?

756
00:52:02,433 --> 00:52:04,667
What's wrong with you?

757
00:52:04,667 --> 00:52:06,867
<i>Apply it on your eyelids like this.</i>

758
00:52:06,867 --> 00:52:09,967
<i>Dab the center of your ears too.</i>

759
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:11,700
<i>What next?</i>

760
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,500
<i>Make sure to apply it evenly.</i>

761
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,300
<i>Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.</i>

762
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:20,733
<i>When blending, lower your middle finger
slightly to reduce the area...</i>

763
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,800
Miss.

764
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,833
Jun's mom, mind giving me a ride?

765
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,133
Oh! Of course not.

766
00:52:34,133 --> 00:52:35,767
Get in, get in.

767
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:41,067
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

768
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,933
Miss.

769
00:52:50,933 --> 00:52:54,867
About the other day...
We were just trying to be hospitable.

770
00:52:54,867 --> 00:52:58,800
Accepting meals from parents
violates the Kim Yeong Ran Act,

771
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,300
but me treating you is fine, right?

772
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,533
What do you mean?

773
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:06,300
I was thinking of holding
a welcome party in our yard today.

774
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,100
Whose welcome party?

775
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,767
Mine.

776
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:12,667
We'd love that.

777
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:15,167
This isn't just your welcome party,

778
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:17,967
but it's more like neighbors
getting together for a meal.

779
00:53:17,967 --> 00:53:19,933
That's small-town hospitality, you know.

780
00:53:19,933 --> 00:53:21,433
Lovely.

781
00:53:21,433 --> 00:53:22,800
Where are you going, Miss?

782
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,833
To the kindergarten.

783
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,000
But it's Saturday.

784
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,633
Huh?

785
00:53:29,433 --> 00:53:30,867
<i>This is the Women's Association President.</i>

786
00:53:30,867 --> 00:53:34,567
<i>Today at 5 PM at Mr. Jeon Dong Min's house,</i>

787
00:53:34,567 --> 00:53:38,133
<i>we're hosting a welcome party
for our new neighbor, Ms. Bu Se Mi.</i>

788
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:40,467
<i>All residents should pause their work</i>

789
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:42,967
<i>- and attend.</i>
- Are we really holding the welcome dinner today?

790
00:53:42,967 --> 00:53:48,633
Yeah, Dong Min, we decided to hold it.

791
00:53:48,633 --> 00:53:50,533
Oh, my.

792
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:53,333
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

793
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:54,833
Madam... No, no.

794
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:56,967
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

795
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,100
A welcome party? Seriously?

796
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,533
Don't you know this breaks the Kim Yeong Ran Act?

797
00:54:01,533 --> 00:54:04,200
This is a huge problem.

798
00:54:06,733 --> 00:54:10,400
Yes, that's why
I decided to host the dinner myself.

799
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,833
To get to know the neighbors
and build relationships.

800
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:16,433
I've heard Dongwaru's food is great.

801
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:24,367
- Here.
- Miss, why are you like this?

802
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:27,300
Normally, as the principal,
I would handle all this...

803
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,400
- Understood.
- No.

804
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,867
I'm good at things like this.

805
00:54:32,867 --> 00:54:35,000
I'll prepare everything perfectly.

806
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,933
Don't worry, let go of this and answer the phone.

807
00:54:37,933 --> 00:54:41,267
I receive your sincerity.

808
00:54:41,967 --> 00:54:43,667
Alright, then.

809
00:54:55,467 --> 00:54:59,700
[Muchang Mart]

810
00:55:11,067 --> 00:55:12,733
Huh?

811
00:55:17,533 --> 00:55:19,167
Oh, my. He's...

812
00:55:19,167 --> 00:55:20,967
Hey, Jeon Dong Min! What are you doing there?

813
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:23,233
Grab a shopping cart and get in here fast.

814
00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:26,200
Hurry up, we don't have time.
Come on, Dong Min. Ugh, seriously.

815
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,833
Okay.

816
00:55:29,733 --> 00:55:31,367
Jeez.

817
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,000
Dong Min, put the snacks and dried side dishes

818
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,533
in there with some love.

819
00:55:41,533 --> 00:55:44,433
But Ms. Bu's hosting the welcome party.
Why are we doing this?

820
00:55:44,433 --> 00:55:46,233
Because Ms. Bu has other matters to handle.

821
00:55:46,233 --> 00:55:48,067
This is how we help each other in life.

822
00:55:48,067 --> 00:55:51,833
Why are you always so grumpy with her?

823
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,533
Did you also get bribed by her money?

824
00:55:55,533 --> 00:55:57,000
To make you take her side?

825
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,533
No, nothing like that!

826
00:56:00,867 --> 00:56:02,800
This is really weird.

827
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,067
But, why does Ms. Bu Se Mi

828
00:56:05,067 --> 00:56:08,400
even need to be in Muchang,
spending money to bribe people?

829
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,533
Why did Don recommend her anyway?

830
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,700
You're too suspicious.

831
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,967
She just likes the countryside,

832
00:56:14,967 --> 00:56:17,000
wants to make friends,

833
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,200
and has money to spend.

834
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,700
You wouldn't understand because you don't have it.

835
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,733
Dong Min, if you won't help me,
go stand over there.

836
00:56:23,733 --> 00:56:27,033
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

837
00:56:27,033 --> 00:56:29,700
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

838
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,833
I'll bring the dried side dishes.

839
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:35,967
Hallelujah, hallelujah.

840
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,667
Hallelujah.

841
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,600
Why's it so quiet here?

842
00:56:47,867 --> 00:56:49,700
Ms. Baek Hye Ji?

843
00:56:55,067 --> 00:56:56,700
Ms. Baek Hye...

844
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,200
Baek Hye Ji!

845
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,933
[Baek Hye Ji]

846
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,900
<i>The subscriber you dialed
is not available. Please leave a message...</i>

847
00:57:23,067 --> 00:57:24,700
What?

848
00:57:29,867 --> 00:57:31,600
Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

849
00:57:36,167 --> 00:57:37,467
What?

850
00:57:37,467 --> 00:57:39,300
Where did she disappear to?

851
00:57:49,367 --> 00:57:51,133
Oh, no, what do I do?

852
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:52,867
Hello, everyone.

853
00:57:52,867 --> 00:57:54,900
Thank you for your hard work.

854
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,467
Please take care of this.

855
00:57:57,467 --> 00:57:59,867
- Wow, this is amazing.
- What's all this?

856
00:57:59,867 --> 00:58:02,600
Ms. Bu Se Mi prepared everything.

857
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,133
She's someone who truly loves the children.

858
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:08,033
We don't even have a play café here, you know.

859
00:58:08,033 --> 00:58:10,233
Ah, I'm honestly envious.

860
00:58:10,233 --> 00:58:13,333
How rich does she have to be
for a kindergarten teacher to go this far?

861
00:58:13,333 --> 00:58:15,533
- Unbelievable.
- Hey.

862
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:19,533
Dong Min, put the makgeolli
in the farmhouse fridge.

863
00:58:19,533 --> 00:58:20,933
There's no space here.

864
00:58:20,933 --> 00:58:23,500
- Okay.
- Oh, Ju Won will love this!

865
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,033
Ah, he's going to love this.

866
00:58:25,033 --> 00:58:26,700
Please handle this well.

867
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,867
This is wonderful.

868
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:47,367
Miss, I'll just leave the makgeolli here and go.

869
00:58:55,367 --> 00:58:57,033
CCTV.

870
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,733
Dong Min.

871
00:58:58,733 --> 00:59:00,367
Yes?

872
00:59:05,567 --> 00:59:07,433
What's that?

873
00:59:07,433 --> 00:59:08,633
Oh, this?

874
00:59:08,633 --> 00:59:10,400
Makgeolli. For the welcome party later.

875
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,367
Wait a second.

876
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:19,100
Can we talk privately?

877
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:22,933
Let me put that down first. Just a moment.

878
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:42,500
Miss, why are you so close to me?

879
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:44,967
Oh.

880
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:48,500
When did I do that?

881
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,300
Right now.

882
00:59:53,433 --> 00:59:54,467
I'll just put this here.

883
00:59:54,467 --> 00:59:56,733
I said stay still.

884
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:02,867
Everything arrived at once.

885
01:00:02,867 --> 01:00:05,500
This needs to chill in the cooler.

886
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,967
- Cooler?
- Makgeolli should be served cold.

887
01:00:06,967 --> 01:00:08,672
The cooler.

888
01:00:08,672 --> 01:00:11,470
- Let me put this here.
- Good work.

889
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:14,333
- Is here okay?
- It's fine.

890
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:18,400
Shouldn't we mix the food varieties?

891
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,200
Pair them with tasty sides.

892
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,667
All the fried rice is here.

893
01:00:28,133 --> 01:00:29,900
Hey, Tae Min, this is...

894
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:40,033
You seem like a new face...

895
01:00:40,767 --> 01:00:43,100
Who are you looking for?

896
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:46,000
Is Teacher Bu Se Mi here?

897
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:50,467
Huh? Who?

898
01:00:50,467 --> 01:00:52,200
Teacher Bu Se Mi.

899
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,133
Yes, she's here. And you are?

900
01:00:56,767 --> 01:00:58,000
Oh.

901
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,633
I'm...

902
01:01:02,967 --> 01:01:04,833
Se Mi's friend.

903
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:22,600
Oh, what are you doing?

904
01:01:24,233 --> 01:01:27,000
I might not seem like it,
but I'm very traditional.

905
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,400
- I'll put this down quickly.
- Dong Min!

906
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,933
It's been a while.

907
01:02:47,933 --> 01:02:49,733
My friend.

908
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,600
Thank you for welcoming me.

909
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:50,133
How on earth did Ms. Baek Hye Ji
find out I'm here?

910
01:03:50,133 --> 01:03:52,933
Oh, no. Baek Hye Ji!

911
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:55,400
There are no secrets in this world, you know.

912
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:58,933
If you let dogs and pigs look down on you,
you become the dog and pig. Understand?

913
01:03:58,933 --> 01:04:02,100
I might be able to find out
where our Yeong Ran is.

914
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,367
Attorney Lee, where did you hide Kim Yeong Ran?

915
01:04:04,367 --> 01:04:07,133
If you're in Muchang,
you have to follow Muchang's rules.

916
01:04:07,133 --> 01:04:08,533
- Stop it.
- Ms. Se Mi.

917
01:04:08,533 --> 01:04:12,333
You may have a sharp tongue,
but I think you're actually a kind person.
