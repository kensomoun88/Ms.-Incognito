You turn it off.

This is right in front of a kindergarten.

this is clearly disrupting their lesson, right?

because someone reported this, pal.

00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,633
No, no need.

163

at Muchang Kindergarten too.

took care of every little detail.

could you stop paying so much attention to me?

178
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Totally rude.

00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,700
So, the kids cried and were a mess, right?

363
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,600
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

364
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,967

Dong Min, I get how you feel.

367
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:20,167
But without a teacher,
the kindergarten would have to close.

368
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:22,833
Yeah, maybe this time will be different.

369
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:25,533
Still, throwing a welcome party might be too much.

Did you see the news today?

372

A kindergarten teacher hitting kids
was the headline.

Really?

374
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,400
- What?
- How could it be?

Never judge a book by its cover.

- Get her a drink!

380

Oh my, what now?

382

Oh, no.

There's nothing to eat at home.

Earlier, you told me to shut up.

It's late tonight. I'll have ramyeon.

Wait, you're not giving her food?

Should I... carry it?

395
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,467
- Pardon?
- Should I bring it in for you?

396
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:43,033
No, it's fine. I'll take it.

397

She doesn't seem

If we can't find a teacher this time either,

Muchang Kindergarten itself
will shut down next year.

00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,533
Then, our kids will have to ride the shuttle bus

- Yes.

But how do we keep her?

437
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:44,100
If Seong Tae uses cash bribes,
we honestly have no alternatives.

438

Seoul people tend to be wary
if someone is overly kind for no reason.

Jeon Ju Won, come with me.

<i>Dad told me not to give
my heart easily to the new teacher.</i>

538
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:27,667
I don't plan to give it either.

541
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:49,433
- Now, leave.
- Wait a second.

542
00:39:49,433 --> 00:39:50,700
- Wait, just...
- Why?

543
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,567
Open it up.

544
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:54,667
This is trespassing.

545
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:58,200
Attorney Lee, why should we leave?

546
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,872
- Hey.
- What?

547
00:39:59,872 --> 00:40:02,800
Uh, this... It's that.

548
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,100
This is wrongful termination.

549
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,133
Yes, wrongful termination.

550
00:40:05,133 --> 00:40:06,367
Wrongful termination?

551
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:07,633
Isn't it?

552
00:40:07,633 --> 00:40:09,167
Wrongful termination.

553
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:10,767
A deal?

554
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:15,233
Wrongful termination means an employer
can't fire someone without just cause.

555
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:18,100
The key here is 'just cause.'

556
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,600
Let's set aside legal terms and speak plainly.

557
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,000
Butler Choi and Mr. Yang Cheol Su.

558
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,667
- Yes.
- Right here.

559
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,833
Who are your employers?

560
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:29,800
Cheol Su! Chairman Ga Sung Ho!

561
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,933
- Wrong!
- Kim Yeong Ran! Madam!

562
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:33,033
Correct answer.

563
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:35,100
- I was about to say that...
- Hey.

564
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,133
This isn't the time to celebrate.

565
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:38,733
After Chairman Ga Sung Ho passed away,

566
00:40:38,733 --> 00:40:41,133
Ms. Kim Yeong Ran naturally became the owner.

567
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:44,133
Meaning your employer is Ms. Kim Yeong Ran.

568
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:45,200
But you two,

569
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,433
do you both realize
what you've done to your employer?

570
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:49,867
No, that's...

571
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:53,000
Since the previous owner suddenly passed away,

572
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,933
- the handover...
- The handover

573
00:40:54,933 --> 00:40:57,700
wasn't properly done, so we made a mistake.

574
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,867
'A dog that's bitten once tends to bite again.'

575
00:40:59,867 --> 00:41:02,433
Attorney Lee, calling me a dog? That's Cheol Su.

576
00:41:02,433 --> 00:41:03,433
Oh, are you talking to me?

577
00:41:03,433 --> 00:41:04,433
You called me a dog?

578
00:41:04,433 --> 00:41:07,367
Attorney Lee, I won't bite again.

579
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:10,300
Wait, I'll pull out my fangs.

580
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,867
I've added some severance pay.

581
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:14,167
- Take this at least.
- Thank you.

582
00:41:15,233 --> 00:41:16,833
Wait.

583
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:19,667

584
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:21,400
Yang Cheol Su.

585
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,333
Listen carefully from now on.

586
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:27,833
I listened to you and ended up like this.

587
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,133
Ah, our Hye Ji.

588
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:31,567
Hye Ji said she has 100 million in savings.

589
00:41:32,467 --> 00:41:35,767
I know who we should turn to.

590
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:37,500
Who is that?

591
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,133
Who else?

592
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:40,533
The professor.

593
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:43,733
She must have a plan.

594
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:49,752
Wait, wait. Wait for me.

595
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,133
Only my back hurts.

596
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,767
Wow, chicken.

597
00:42:47,767 --> 00:42:50,333
I'll stay here until Madam returns.

598
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,700
Act like you're invisible, Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

599
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,700
Attorney Lee, have you eaten?

600
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,067
Didn't I tell you?

601
00:42:56,067 --> 00:42:59,667
'Leave the cooking to the chef,
and the chicken to the chicken shop.'

602
00:42:59,667 --> 00:43:02,367
Don't want homemade food?

603
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:04,167
This isn't my home.

604
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,433
Ah, one more thing,

605
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:09,300
stay out of the main house
except during meals, Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

606
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,433
Alright.

607
00:43:10,433 --> 00:43:13,200
Attorney, you know, um...

608
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,267
Where exactly is Madam?

609
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,033
Why should I have to explain that
to you, Ms. Baek Hye Ji?

610
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,300
Because Madam and I are friends.
You little troublemaker.

611
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,033
Have you heard from Professor Ga Seon Yeong?

612
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:32,867
No.

613
00:43:32,867 --> 00:43:37,867
If Professor Ga approaches you even once,
tell me immediately, Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

614
00:43:38,633 --> 00:43:40,267
Okay.

615
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:45,233
Yes... Why do I have to tell you?

616
00:43:45,233 --> 00:43:48,333
Listen to people until the end.

617
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:49,933
Hmph.

618
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,500
Muchang must be peaceful, right?

619
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,400
Dong Min, did you talk with the teacher yesterday?

620
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,200
Does she prefer spicy red ramyeon? Or mild?

621
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,833
Don't know.

622
00:45:00,233 --> 00:45:03,100
Do you think she likes soju? Or beer?

623
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,733
Wait, she probably prefers wine. Right?

624
00:45:05,733 --> 00:45:07,133
No idea.

625
00:45:07,133 --> 00:45:09,467
Ugh, you two barely talked.

626
00:45:09,467 --> 00:45:11,233
No progress at all.

627
00:45:11,233 --> 00:45:13,233
She hates bean rice. Bean rice!

628
00:45:13,233 --> 00:45:16,167
Whoa, how'd you figure that out? Impressive.

629
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:18,300
Did things already move forward?

630
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,667
Jeez. What could a single guy like you even know?

631
00:45:23,833 --> 00:45:26,333
We even changed the strawberry variety
using the agricultural loan.

632
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:29,100
Why are the seedlings so wilted?

633
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,333
Hey, guys.

634
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:31,767
You need to grow big and strong.

635
00:45:31,767 --> 00:45:35,100
So Ju Won can go to cram school
and learn piano. Right?

636
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,733
Don't you agree?

637
00:45:37,933 --> 00:45:41,333
Don't worry, Uncle Dong Min. We'll strike it rich.

638
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,867

639

But,

642
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,500

- How is she?

Don sent her all the way to the kindergarten.

661
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,700
I feel like he's subtly
trying to introduce her to me.

662
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,933
Introduce her?

663
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:17,767
He wants me to vet her as his potential match.

664
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:20,967
Top education, good family background.
Perfect for Don, right?

665
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,267
Then do a thorough background check, sis.

666
00:47:24,267 --> 00:47:26,967
People fake degrees and careers these days, right?

667
00:47:26,967 --> 00:47:31,367
Check her past workplaces for any incidents.

679
00:48:11,633 --> 00:48:14,033
I'd like to inquire about installing CCTV.

680
00:48:14,033 --> 00:48:15,867
Can it be done today?

681
00:48:15,867 --> 00:48:17,700
Money isn't an issue.

682
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:31,500
Hey, is this Kim Yeong Ran?

683
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,867
Yes, correct.

684
00:48:32,867 --> 00:48:35,967
We verified multiple times
through airport CCTV footage.

685
00:48:35,967 --> 00:48:37,333
Then, where is she now?

686
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:38,400
We're tracking her.

687
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,200
Seoul's CCTV isn't accessible to everyone.

688
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,333
It's challenging to trace her.

689
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,167
Wow, unbelievable.

690
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:49,100
What is she doing in the meantime?

691
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,800
Professor, Lee Don changed the will's
release date to the shareholders' meeting.

692
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,367
All heirs must attend.

693
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:58,000
We need to obtain it before then.

694
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,533
I already checked all bank VIP vaults.

00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:09,033
He probably kept it at home.

Yes, Professor.

00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,300
I love these photos. Send me the best ones.

702
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,767
We should file a missing person report.

00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,200
Why did you come all the way to Muchang?

717
00:50:39,933 --> 00:50:42,167
I'm about to

718
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:44,667
tell you the reason now.

719
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:52,367
<i>Since childhood, I followed my professor father</i>

720
00:50:52,367 --> 00:50:54,433
<i>living abroad at times.</i>

721
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:57,833
<i>During college breaks, I volunteered in Africa</i>

722
00:50:57,833 --> 00:51:02,167
<i>and realized education's crucial importance.</i>

723
00:51:02,167 --> 00:51:03,633
Then I heard about

724
00:51:03,633 --> 00:51:08,867
a principal in Muchang embodying Iseon's spirit.

725
00:51:08,867 --> 00:51:12,967
I desperately wanted to teach children here.

726
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:18,133
You're exactly the teacher we've been waiting for.

727
00:51:18,133 --> 00:51:20,833
And arriving just before orientation,

728
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:24,633
we're so fortunate to have
someone like you, Ms. Bu Se Mi.

729

Shall we see the classrooms now?

730
00:51:30,133 --> 00:51:32,367
The children will arrive by shuttle soon.

731
00:51:32,367 --> 00:51:33,933
You can leave your bag here.

732
00:51:33,933 --> 00:51:37,200

739
00:51:58,267 --> 00:51:59,700

And his kids promised to sell me this land.

752
00:52:31,133 --> 00:52:32,867
I'll pay the full deposit tomorrow.

753
00:52:32,867 --> 00:52:36,933

kids will spend hours commuting by bus.

Soon there'll be more elders needing nursing homes
