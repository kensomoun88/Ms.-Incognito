00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,633
Well, he might like a woman like that.

184
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,333
- Cheol Su.
- Yeah, why?

185
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:00,867
Did I mention?

186
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,133
Mention what?

187
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:06,767
This winter, I'll cash out my savings.

188
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:08,367
About 100 million won.

189
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,667
Oh.

190
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,333
Why are you telling me that?

191
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:18,233
Just...

192
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,533
Thinking of having ramyeon for dinner?

193
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:22,533
- Yeah.
- Ugh.

194
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,633
I do love ramyeon too, you know?

195
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:29,667
Want to share some?

196
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,667
Great idea.

197
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,667
By the way, when did you save all that?

198
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,933
Just little by little.

199
00:15:36,933 --> 00:15:40,167
[Muchang County]
You'll stay here for three months.

200
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:42,133
Muchang?

201
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:45,833
Yes. No train station, four hours by car.

202
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,767
It's a very peaceful place.

203
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:51,967
It's the kind of town where you even know
how many spoons the neighbor has.

204
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:54,333
Is there really a need to go
all the way to Muchang?

205
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:58,867
You risked your life for money too.
Do you think others are any different?

206
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:00,367
If the siblings

207
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:03,400
find out you're the heir,

208
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,367
they'll come after you just like 15 years ago.

209
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:12,100
It's a good place to hide from those chasing you.

210
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,567
And if they send a hitman,

211
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:20,000
it's perfect for setting a trap.

212
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,167
What are they doing inside?

213
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,933
What is this?

214
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:52,767
It's a resume.

215
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,367

Iseon Women's University,
Early Childhood Education majored.

218
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:04,300
I chose the least suspicious
and harmless cover as a kindergarten teacher.

219
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,133
Coincidentally, my sister runs
a kindergarten in Muchang.

220
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:09,300
Since she's so kind-hearted...

221
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:26,533
She won't die easily.

222
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:35,133
Oh my goodness.

223
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:40,600

Chairman.

225
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,667
I was just cleaning the door.

226
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:50,133
I'll pay more than Seon Yeong,

227
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:53,067
so could you stop fussing over the food now?

228
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,667
Well...

229
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:01,500
How much more will you give me?

230
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,400
Spend as much as you want.

231
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:18,967
Thank you, Chairman.

232
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:41,133
See?

233
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:44,667
In this place, money can buy anything.

234
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:47,600
Yesterday's ally becomes today's enemy

235
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,733
and Seoul, especially this house,
is the most dangerous.

236
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:55,900
I'll go to Muchang.

237
00:18:56,833 --> 00:19:02,067
Don't you dare die before the shareholders'
meeting in three months, Madam.

238
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:36,400
<i>This batch of strawberries is the sweetest. Enjoy!</i>

239
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,067
<i>I'll see you in two weeks.</i>

240
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:41,967
I was wondering when you'd come.

241
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,233
There's one thing I'm curious about.

242
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:05,967
Why do these Muchang strawberries
taste so exceptionally good?

243
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:08,633
Oh, well...

244
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:11,267
Speak comfortably.

245
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:13,167
Ah, yes.

246
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:17,367
For the strawberries to grow well,

247
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:20,367
the weather can't be too hot
or too cold all year round.

248
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:23,133
The soil is rich, and there's plenty of water.

249
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:25,900
Muchang is just the perfect place for that.

250
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,533
What a wonderful place.

251
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:40,700
How long does it take to get here from Muchang?

252
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,000
About four hours by car.

253
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,800
Excuse me, Chairman.

254
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,333
May I ask just one thing?

255
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,733
Yes.

256
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:55,167
How do you like our strawberries?

257
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:59,633
I'm not a charity worker.

258
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,867
I ate them because they're good. That's all.

259
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:11,400
Oh, why's Chairman out in the garden?

260
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,833
Madam, you know that there are
main characters in novels, right?

261
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,700
He's just... one of the others.

262
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,333
Not a lead, not even a supporting role.

263
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:28,167
Not curious.

264
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,933
Oh, you really aren't curious, huh?

265
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,533
- See you again.
- Yes.

266
00:22:09,867 --> 00:22:12,800
These strawberries are delicious. Have some.

267
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,833
Yes, Chairman.

268
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:27,067
Hello?

269
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:28,867
Chairman!

270
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:31,367
Chairman!

271
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:55,867
Chairman.

272
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:57,700
Chairman!

273
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:01,567
Chairman, are you okay?

274
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:03,500
Be quiet.

275
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,333
Chairman.

276
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:10,333
Chairman.

277
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:25,433
Chairman, if we use morphine,
we won't be able to hide it anymore.

278
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:29,033
Dr... Dr. Kim.

279
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:32,533
Chairman.

280
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,333
You should prepare yourself mentally.

281
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,367
Your condition has worsened.

282
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:47,233
You likely won't last more than three months now.

283
00:23:52,267 --> 00:23:56,833
You'll need morphine more frequently now.

284
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,267
She's pretty?

285
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,633
Not me.

286
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:47,833
Having an affair with your
hospital nurse? How predictable.

287
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:52,733
Even your mother, if you think about it,
remarried her company's factory manager.

288
00:24:57,933 --> 00:25:00,600
How dare you compare yourself to my mom?

289
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,167
Go on, say it.

290
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,667
Yes, Professor.

291
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:49,833
They'd been cleverly hiding it
on the chart, but it was morphine.

292
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,100
Since morphine is a controlled drug,

293
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,067
it's legally restricted
to terminal cancer patients.

294
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:56,433
<i>They can't hide it anymore.</i>

295
00:25:56,433 --> 00:25:58,467
Terminal cancer?

296
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:01,967
How much time does my father have left?

297
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:03,567
<i>Usually, with morphine treatment,</i>

298
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:05,433
it's no more than three months.

299
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:07,467
It means the pain is going to be unbearable.

300
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:11,067
He hid all this to keep
his children from worrying.

301
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,967
Thank you, Ms. Kim.

302
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:18,767
I'll transfer your payment to your account.

303
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:26,567
About the medical article you wrote last time.

304
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,833
'Miracles can happen even
for terminal cancer patients.'

305
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,233
Could I possibly get
that renowned doctor's contact information?

306
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,767
My father...

307
00:26:46,733 --> 00:26:48,933
has terminal cancer.

308
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:53,733
Yes.

309
00:26:55,767 --> 00:27:00,233
Please get me that contact quickly.

310
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:04,300
Thank you.

311
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,667
Bravo!

312
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:21,000
My sister really is a theater and film professor.

313
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,933
Your acting.

314
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:31,600
Am I really becoming
the chairman of Gaseong Group?

315
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,200
Finally, we're reclaiming
the inheritance left by Mom,

316
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,733
after 28 years.

317
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,733
Yes!

318
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,500
Where are you going?

319
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,033
I need to go home.

320
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:19,800
Yeong Ran.

321
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,167
Let's carry out

322
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:26,467
my euthanasia tonight.

323
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:31,800
What?

324
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,300
You saw it too.

325
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,067
That pain...

326
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:40,533
I never want to experience that again.

327
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,067
I've already asked Dr. Kim.

328
00:28:47,567 --> 00:28:49,633
You just need to bring it.

329
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,933
Only give this to Chairman when he's struggling.

330
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:06,200
Ah, come in.

331
00:30:13,233 --> 00:30:16,033
Put that down for now.

332
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,767
Go check if Butler Choi has finished
preparing the ramyeon.

333
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:27,733
I want ramyeon for my last meal.

334
00:30:27,733 --> 00:30:31,467
It's my plan, so you have to be there
for the very last part too.

335
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:39,333
Keep an eye on Butler Choi
and make sure she's not up to anything.

336
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:47,200
You're going to make me
eat the soggy last ramyeon?

337
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,600
Understood.

338
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,733
I'll be right back.

339
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,500
The Chairman is asking if the ramyeon's ready.

340
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,733
Huh?

341
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:12,167
One minute left. Wait a moment longer.

342
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:15,967
The chairman insisted it be cooked
exactly according to the recipe.

343
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:17,867
Alright.

344
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,033
Ye Rim.

345
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,267
We'll meet again soon.

346
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:35,067
Cooked for 5 minutes exactly
according to the recipe. Perfect.

347
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:20,400

348
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:43,700
Chairman!

349
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,000
Chairman!

350
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,833
What's happening?

351
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:49,733
Too many eyes watching.

352
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,233
What?

353
00:34:05,233 --> 00:34:08,000
- Attorney Lee...
- What's the matter?

354
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:11,867
Attorney.

355
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,167
<i>Why did the chairman change the plan?</i>

356
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,067
<i>Hard to say.</i>

357
00:35:25,067 --> 00:35:29,300
<i>It seems the Chairman truly believed
you would succeed, Ms. Kim Yeong Ran.</i>

358

to have taken his own life</i>

00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:51,700
leave us like that...

364
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,567
Father?

365
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:56,867
I rehearsed this.

366
00:35:56,867 --> 00:36:00,100
I'm technically the chief mourner.

367
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:03,167
Here you are.

368
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:05,033
You're here.

369
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:09,533
The paternal mourning station is to your left.

370
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,500
Thank you.

371
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,033
The family must be enduring immense grief.

372
00:36:15,033 --> 00:36:16,900
I have no words.

373
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,267
Attorney Lee, the shareholders' meeting
is in three months, right?

374
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,600
This family adapts remarkably
fast to circumstances.

375
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,867
What's done is done.

376
00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:29,233
Yes, three months from now.

377
00:36:29,233 --> 00:36:34,333
At that meeting, you'll elect the chairman
to lead the entire Gaseong Group.

378
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:38,633
For Seon Woo to become chairman, we need to
resolve Chairman Ga Sung Ho's stock inheritance.

379
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:39,900
That should happen
before the general meeting, right?

380
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:44,467
Well, but there's been one change in the will.

381
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,900
What?

382
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,267
Here they are.

383
00:37:10,267 --> 00:37:11,767
Just give us one statement.

384
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:13,133
How do you feel?

385
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:15,533
We ask for a brief comment.

386
00:37:28,433 --> 00:37:31,200
[Pray for the repose of Chairman Ga Sung Ho]
Even until the very end, the deceased...

387
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:43,933
[We will forever cherish
his grand vision and warm heart]

388
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,667
What's that?

389
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:52,433
Sorry for the late introduction.

390
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:55,200
That lady over there, our Ms. Kim Yeong Ran.

391
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:10,567
Hey.

392
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:12,600
Isn't that the bodyguard from back then?

393
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,733
No more 'hey', 'you', or 'that person'.

394
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:16,767
Then what?

395
00:38:16,767 --> 00:38:19,033
One month ago, Ms. Kim Yeong Ran over there

396
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:23,067
filed marriage registration documents
with Chairman Ga Sung Ho.

397
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:31,733
Oh my God.

398
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:34,900
My father...

399
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,067
Unbelievable, huh?

400
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:41,667
Wait, what's that on your finger?

401
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:43,767
Isn't that Mom's ring?

402
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:48,400
Why are you wearing that ring?

403
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,333
Take it off.

404
00:38:51,367 --> 00:38:52,867
Take off the ring. Can't you hear me?

405
00:38:52,867 --> 00:38:54,033
This is a funeral home.

406
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:55,433
- Let go!
- Chairman is watching.

407
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,467
What can a dead person see?

408
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:58,433
Hey, take that ring off now! I said take it off!

409
00:38:58,433 --> 00:38:59,767
Do you know what kind of ring that is?

410
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:01,867
Ga Seon Woo!

411
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,633
Attorney Lee.

412
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,300
What did he just say earlier?

413
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,167
Marriage registration?

414
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:33,167
With you?

415
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,333
Didn't you hear?

416
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:39,667
Attorney Lee said that.

417
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:43,567
From now on, I'm not longer
'you,' 'that,' 'this,' or 'that'.

418
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:51,000
Then, if you're not 'this' or 'that,'

419
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,167
what are you?

420
00:39:55,867 --> 00:39:58,633
From now on, I'm your mother.

421
00:40:23,733 --> 00:40:25,500
Excuse me, coming through.

422
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,300
One moment, please. Sorry.

423
00:40:33,967 --> 00:40:38,333
Ugh, Chairman Ga is so tacky.

424
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:41,100
Even in death, he's messing with us, huh?

425
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,567
[We will forever cherish
his grand vision and warm heart]

426
00:40:42,567 --> 00:40:46,033
Oh my God, I'm going crazy here, seriously.

427
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:52,267
Sis, are we really just
going to sit still like this?

428
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:53,900
We need to think of a way.

429
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,167
We can't let that bodyguard
take everything from us.

430
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:58,100
Let's figure out a plan.

431
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,067
Sis, answer me already. This is seriously...

432
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:02,833
I'll never give her money like that.

433
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:27,200
[We will forever cherish
his grand vision and warm heart]

434
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:08,967
Madam, you must have been through a lot.

435
00:42:08,967 --> 00:42:10,933
Friend...

436
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:13,500
Madam, are you okay?

437
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,733
They say couples grow alike.

438
00:42:43,233 --> 00:42:45,367
You scared me!

439
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:47,400
No.

440
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,500
You startled me, Madam.

441
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:53,200
Madam, you were surprised, right?

442
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,300
Ask whatever you want to ask.

443
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,700
Friend.

444
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,000
Did you really marry the chairman?

445
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,833
Yes.

446
00:43:08,567 --> 00:43:10,133
When did you two do that?

447
00:43:10,133 --> 00:43:12,067
When everyone was asleep.

448
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,967
No way, at night?

449
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:18,600
Usually after 11 p.m., once the bell rings.

450
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:22,067
Then

451
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,233
did you kiss the chairman too?

452
00:43:25,233 --> 00:43:26,300
We're a married couple.

453
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,167
Insane.

454
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,600
I misspoke. Sorry.

455
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:34,700
Wait, why have you been using informal speech
with me this whole time?

456
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,700
Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

457
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,067
Yes?

458
00:43:37,067 --> 00:43:39,800
You're a year younger than me, born in '98?

459
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:44,967
- That's...
- What?

460
00:44:00,367 --> 00:44:04,867
Madam, would you like to continue
using your bedroom as is?

461
00:44:06,033 --> 00:44:07,500
We have guest rooms too.

462
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,533
Or should I prepare another room?

463
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,067
It's fine.

464
00:44:18,967 --> 00:44:20,800
Are you truly okay with that?

465
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,600
Yes.

466
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:29,033
Thank you.

467
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:41,367
Ugh, I don't know.

468
00:45:23,367 --> 00:45:25,233
You know Pungsan Paper, right?

469
00:45:25,233 --> 00:45:29,600
It's a small company compared to Gaseong Group,
but a similar uproar happened there.

470
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,367
She seduced the Chairman at a hotel health club

471
00:45:32,367 --> 00:45:35,333
and even registered their marriage
without the family knowing.

472
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:39,267
If the marriage registration is complete,
legally there's no problem.

473
00:45:39,267 --> 00:45:41,100
So?

474
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:45,500
There's nothing we can do?

475
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,167
At this point, we can pursue
a reserved portion lawsuit,

476
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:51,233
but making this public to the masses...

477
00:45:51,233 --> 00:45:53,267
Hey!

478
00:45:53,267 --> 00:45:56,033
Whose money was that originally?

479
00:45:56,033 --> 00:45:57,467
It was originally my mother's.

480
00:45:57,467 --> 00:45:59,767
That means it was originally ours!

481
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:01,133
I know, I get it.

482
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,000
But even if we convert
that wealth to current values,

483
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,400
Chairman Ga Sung Ho's assets

484
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,033
after Madam passed away are far greater.

485
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,800
Watch the situation carefully and mind your words.

486
00:46:35,333 --> 00:46:37,233
Attorney Kim.

487
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,733
Yes.

488
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:45,133
Darn it.

489
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,867
Instead of billing for fees and medical costs

490
00:46:52,867 --> 00:46:57,200
and making excuses, use your head.

491
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,000
Okay?

492
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,333
Come on!

493
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:03,300
Let's get this right.

494
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,867
Professor.

495
00:47:31,867 --> 00:47:34,033
You want Madam to be stuck in this house?

496
00:47:34,033 --> 00:47:35,400
The funeral procession is tomorrow.

497
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,233
<i>Who's Madam?</i>

498
00:47:37,233 --> 00:47:40,100
Ah, sorry, Professor.

499
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,200
You mean keep Kim Yeong Ran

500
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,600
from taking a single
step out of this house, right?

501
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,300
But how do we stop someone with legs?

502
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,633
Ah, yes.

503
00:47:52,633 --> 00:47:57,500
Wait, does that mean we'll get something too?

504
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,000
Yes, Professor.

505
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,033
Thank you, yes.

506
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,167
- Cheol Su.
- Yes?

507
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:24,333
You're on SNS now? Hurry up and follow me!

508
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:25,433
Ah, why?

509
00:48:25,433 --> 00:48:27,767
Hurry up!

510
00:48:27,767 --> 00:48:29,633
What's wrong?

511
00:48:40,867 --> 00:48:42,733
Why are you doing this to me?

512
00:48:42,733 --> 00:48:45,600
Cheol Su, Cheol Su, Cheol Su.

513
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,800
What now?

514
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,367
I think I'm about to get 100 million won.

515
00:48:50,367 --> 00:48:52,167
100 million won?

516
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:54,233
From where?

517
00:48:54,233 --> 00:48:58,400
The professor wants us to keep
Yeong Ran detained for a week.

518
00:49:00,567 --> 00:49:01,833
But how?

519
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:05,267
I'll handle the brains,
you handle the muscle. Got it?

520
00:49:05,267 --> 00:49:06,300
Got it.

521
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,900
Wake up early tomorrow morning.

522
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,967
Ugh, okay.

523
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,933
Hey, friend!

524
00:49:26,933 --> 00:49:28,800
Madam!

525
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:33,567
Butler Choi and Yang Cheol Su
are trying to keep you detained.

526
00:49:35,067 --> 00:49:36,767
How do you know that?

527
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,133
Me?

528
00:49:38,133 --> 00:49:40,867
I eavesdropped in the living room.

529
00:49:40,867 --> 00:49:45,100
They said Ga Seon Yeong will
give them 100 million if they hold you.

530
00:50:11,767 --> 00:50:13,300
Oh my, that's...

531
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,433
Isn't that club a bit too much?

532
00:50:14,433 --> 00:50:17,833
Come on, Yeong Ran has trained in Taekwondo
and Hapkido with several dan ranks,

533
00:50:17,833 --> 00:50:19,433
and yet this still seems insufficient.

534
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,233
Right.

535
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,133
[Gold-digger]

536
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,400
Yes, Madam.

537
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,333
I brewed some really good coffee for you.

538
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:38,167
I prepared it for you to drink
before the funeral procession.

539
00:50:38,167 --> 00:50:39,833
Understood.

540
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:41,633
Okay.

541
00:51:32,433 --> 00:51:33,900
Madam.

542
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:37,933
This is my favorite Costa Rica coffee.

543
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,867
Butler Choi?
