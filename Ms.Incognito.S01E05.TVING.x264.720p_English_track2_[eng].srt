00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,467
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,600
Oh, my.

4
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,933
Your skin is so fair.

5
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh my goodness.

6
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:13,233
It's been so long.

7
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,000
My friend.

8
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,400
My friend, what's going on here?

9
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,100
Friend?

10
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,900
This is Baek Hye Ji.

11
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:50,767
My friend!

12
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,900
You're still the same.

13
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,533
Uh, I have something to talk about with my friend.

14
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:03,067
Oh, okay, go ahead.

15
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,933
Excuse me.

16
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,567
Yes?

17
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,967
You dropped something.

18
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:25,833
Something important.

19
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:32,367
Oh! You're right.

20
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:35,900
How could you drop something so important?

21
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,233
- People must be waiting.
- Yes.

22
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:41,467
Hurry up and go.

23
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:45,867
See you later.

24
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:50,533
Muchang Strawberries?

25
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:58,300
How did you know I was here?

26
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,667
Did Ga Seon Yeong send you?

27
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:04,867
Yeong Ran, there are no secrets in this world.

28
00:04:04,867 --> 00:04:07,333
And you're being so cold-hearted.

29
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,867
What's with Ga Seon Yeong?

30
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:11,733
She's your daughter.

31
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:16,200
Just kidding.

32
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,700
But if the professor finds out you're here,

33
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,667
she said she'd reward me handsomely.

34
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,300
That part is true.

35
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:36,867
What do you really want, Ms. Baek Hye Ji?

36
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:39,533
Why should I care?

37
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:43,433
The reward is what the giver decides.

38
00:04:44,672 --> 00:04:48,367
Miss, all is ready!

39
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:50,767
Friend, what day is it today?

40
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:53,533
I couldn't even eat a meal
coming all the way here.

41
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:55,167
Great!

42
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:59,200
Let's finish our talk before leaving.

43
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,267
What talk?

44
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,133
How much do you want?

45
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:04,933
How much will it take for you
to shut up and leave quietly?

46
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:10,067
Our Yeong Ran

47
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:14,233
has become a chaebol wife,
but you haven't changed at all.

48
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:16,133
No,

49
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:19,067
should I call you Ms. Bu Se Mi now?

50
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:21,167
Answer me first.

51
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,100
Tell me what you want.

52
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,967
A billion won?

53
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:29,567
Are you serious?

54
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:31,633
No.

55
00:05:31,633 --> 00:05:33,233
Ten billion won?

56
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,233
You want to die, huh?

57
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:38,300
Yeong Ran.

58
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,300
You're being awfully casual with me now.

59
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,233
Yeong Ran, I told you.

60
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:47,100
Let's eat, drink coffee,
and watch movies together.

61
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,300
That's all I want.

62
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,033
Of course, you'll pay for everything.

63
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:54,867
Now, we're really friends from today, right?

64
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:05,200
Or should I have a serious talk
with the Muchang strawberry guy?

65
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:13,533
I've made a friend now too.

66
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,100
I'm leaving now. I'm hungry.

67
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:22,600
Please don't do anything foolish.

68
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,967
I'm asking you, friend.

69
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:31,267
Okay.

70
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,500
How in the world did Baek Hye Ji find me?

71
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,367
Get ready, folks.

72
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:01,800
She's out!

73
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,567
She's here. Get ready.

74
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:07,400
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

75
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,933
Welcome!

76
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,733
Well, you are treating us.

77
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,433
[Welcome, Ms. Bu Se Mi]
We couldn't just stand by.

78
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:21,300
Meals and gifts under 50,000 won
don't violate ethics laws.

79
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,367
So this banner

80
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,800
cost 40,000 won from
our regular vendor for village events,

81
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,000
and these fireworks were delivered
in the early morning for 9,800 won.

82
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Total 49,800 won. A safe solution.

83
00:07:34,233 --> 00:07:39,800
Ms. Bu Se Mi, this is our heartfelt gesture.

84
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,000
We love you.

85
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:44,888
Fireworks!

86
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,433
Everyone, let's eat.

87
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:58,167
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

88
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,667
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

89
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,667
Please have your meal
before the noodles get soggy.

90
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,533
Sit here.

91
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:06,033
Miss, look at that bounce house over there.

92
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:08,133
The kids love it.

93
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:09,767
You should check it out.

94
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,167
Come this way.

95
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:13,033
- Friend.
- Wait, Ms. Bu's friend.

96
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:15,267
Join us for a meal.

97
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,533
Wait, did you come all the way
from Seoul to Muchang just to see her?

98
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,900
Everyone, having fun?

99
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,633
- Yes.
- Yes.

100
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:27,067
Miss Bu Se Mi is the best!

101
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:30,300
- Miss Bu Se Mi is the best!
- Miss Bu Se Mi is the best!

102
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:34,700
The best!

103
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,033
Miss, today feels like my birthday.

104
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:39,067
This is so much fun.

105
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:42,733
This is for you.

106
00:08:46,112 --> 00:08:49,504
I'm back, guys!

107
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:51,392
Are you ready?

108
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:54,153
Come on, climb up.

109
00:08:58,133 --> 00:08:59,767
What?

110
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:01,567
Why is the light on?

111
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:16,867
No.

112
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:19,967
Baek Hye Ji!

113
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,333
[Not on my side: It's going well, right?]

114
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,200
<i>It's going well, right?</i>

115
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:26,867
Oh, it looks delicious.

116
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,300
Wow, you've worked so hard preparing for today.

117
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,800
- Ju Won's father.
- Yes.

118
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,233
We're not just here to eat today, right?

119
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,300
Shouldn't we verify her?

120
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,767
Wait a second.

121
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,533
- Yeah.
- Shouldn't we verify her?

122
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:57,200
Speaking from a police perspective,
people aren't always trustworthy.

123
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,000
Do we really need to verify her?

124
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,700
She seems fine to me.

125
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,767
Hey, Jeong Hwa.

126
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,900
You know you're bad at judging people, right?

127
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,333
Isn't that right, PTA President?

128
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,100
But she's kind.

129
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,600
Is she?

130
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,133
By the way, Miss.
Do you prefer jjamppong or jajangmyeon?

131
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:19,633
I enjoy both equally.

132
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:21,400
That's hard to choose.

133
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,200
Mixed noodles. Just choose mixed noodles.

134
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:29,533
Enjoy your meal.

135
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,967
Miss.

136
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,733
This tastes great.

137
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:40,033
- Enjoy your meal.
- Yes.

138
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:44,133
Well, my younger sister graduated from
Iseon Women's University's business school.

139
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:47,900
When I went to her graduation,
the building was really cool.

140
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,100
Oh.

141
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,633
The business school building?

142
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:52,667
Yeah.

143
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:55,800
The windows there are really big, right?

144
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,100
When I used to attend classes there,
the sunlight would pour in,

145
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,367
and I would get really sleepy.

146
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,700
That's right.

147
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,833
I think my younger sister, Seung Hee,
also mentioned something like that.

148
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,000
Wait, do you know Pyo Seung Hee?

149
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,433
She's a reporter at GNA now.

150
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:15,867
Pyo Seung Hee.

151
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:19,200
I only know her face.

152
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,267
Seung Hee had such pretty eyes, remember?

153
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:26,033
Yeah, that's right.

154
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:28,700
Oh, Lord.

155
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:32,600
Please finish your meal quickly.

156
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,933
Did Seung Hee have beautiful eyes?

157
00:11:34,933 --> 00:11:36,833
She suddenly became prettier.

158
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,467
During the summer vacation of 3rd grade.

159
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:42,300
Oh right.

160
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,467
Miss, then Seung Hee...

161
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:47,867
Right, right. Jeong Woo.

162
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:49,100
Everyone.

163
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,000
I have some good news to share today.

164
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,667
The rumor that Ms. Bu Se Mi has come to

165
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:58,267
our Muchang Iseon Kindergarten has spread
throughout the whole town of Muchang,

166
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:02,167
and we plan to have more students
starting next week.

167
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:07,467
Miss, please say a few words.

168
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,267
Although this is a welcome party for me,

169
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:19,267
I'm so grateful for the wholehearted welcome
you've all given me.

170
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:22,200
I actually heard some bad things

171
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,800
about the previous teachers from Ju Won's father.

172
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:31,567
I understand you couldn't open up to me
because the children were hurt by them.

173
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:35,500
But I'm definitely different from them.

174
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,933
I always keep my promises.

175
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:42,300
Please watch and see.

176
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,700
Alright, let's watch.

177
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,767
- Bu Se Mi!
- Bu Se Mi!

178
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,100
Now, shall we all have a drink?

179
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,533
- Yes.
- Let's drink.

180
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:54,333
- Fill the glasses.
- Okay.

181
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:01,033
Ms. Bu's friend?

182
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:02,833
- Ms. Bu's friend?
- Huh?

183
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:07,233
Wait, so you two are alumni
from Iseon Women's University?

184
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:09,067
The early childhood education department?

185
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:11,133
Ah...

186
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:13,900
- We...
- I majored in ballet.

187
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,433
- Wow.
- Ballet?

188
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:16,833
Should I show you?

189
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,500
Right now?

190
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:25,067
Oh my, oh my.

191
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,133
Wow.

192
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,067
Wow.

193
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:32,067
Wait, that... That...

194
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:34,567

at the dinner table...

195

196
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:37,633
Goodness, how eccentric.

197
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:40,000
- Seriously.
- What's that?

198
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,700

199
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:48,833

00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,567

221
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:00,267
Where did the information leak from?

222
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:02,000

Miss.

00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:16,667
The Commercial Lease Act changed.
You have to guarantee the lease for 10 years.

313
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:20,367
And during those 10 years, you can
only raise the rent by 5% annually.

314

Is that true, Miss?

316

We've only been here for 4 years.

317

So what?

318
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,767
Don't you think it's too low to threaten

319

people in business using their sales?

320
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:37,600
Too low?

321
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,400
When did I threaten anyone?

322
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,767
When did I threaten? I never threatened anyone.

323
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,900
Seems like your memory's failing.

324
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,233
You offered me just 3 million won
to leave the kindergarten.

What's with the glare?

329
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,867
Did you offer money again to make her quit?

330
00:22:00,867 --> 00:22:02,933
No, she didn't take it.

331
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:05,767
So I didn't give it, right?

332
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:07,200
And Miss.

333
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,567
Are you that rich?

334
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:10,933
I don't know how much money you have.

335

339
00:22:19,533 --> 00:22:21,167
Arrest him. Arrest him.

340
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:23,400
Hey, the drunk's disturbance comes first.

341
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:28,467
Why are you picking on only me, huh?

342
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:31,000
Why are you singling me out?

343
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,933
Why are you ostracizing just me?

344
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:36,200
What did I do wrong, huh?

345
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,333
Seong Tae.

346
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,400

- Don't get upset.

347
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,100
- Ugh, fine.
- Was I that wrong?

348
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,167
If your father saw you like this,
he'd rise from his grave.

349

Village Chief, why suddenly bring up
my hardworking father?

350
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:52,133
- My father...
- Everyone out! Take him away!

351
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:54,333
What did my father do that's so terrible?

352
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:57,133
Why are you grabbing my leg?

353
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,467
By the way,

354
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:04,567
why don't you use your real name at the factory?

355
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:08,467
Only you know it.

This is my original name.

357

359
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,867
Yeah.

It's a 'nation's mom' name, but that's not me.

362
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:24,800
So you do have a conscience, huh.

363
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,933
You have a talent for twisting words.

364
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:33,967
Ah, unnie...

365
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:36,267
Should I get you some coffee?

366
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,000
Yes!

367
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,433
And keep calling me So Yeong unnie.

368
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,667
When someone changes their name,
you should call them by it a lot.

369
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,433
Okay, I will!

370
00:23:45,433 --> 00:23:48,167
So Yeong unnie!

371
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,300
- Oh my, what's wrong?
- What are you doing?

372
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,967
What?

373
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,800
What is it?

374
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:08,600
I don't recognize who's who here, jeez.

375
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,333
Excuse me.

376
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:19,667
Me?

377
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:23,300
Don't you know you can't enter
without proper hygiene gear?

378
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:27,900
I'm the exception.

379
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:35,733
Are you the company president or something?

380
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:39,067
Not president...

381
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:44,400
Vice president.

382
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,267
[Kim Hye Ja]

383
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:48,167
Ms. Kim Hye Ja.

384
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:53,333
So Yeong unnie, your coffee.

385
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:57,233
So Yeong left earlier.

386
00:24:57,233 --> 00:24:59,567
But, you said to use the name often.

387
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:00,767
My, you're peculiar.

388
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:01,800
So Yeong unnie.

389
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,200
I said So Yeong left already.

390
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,267
Ms. Kim So Yeong?

391
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:14,567
Your face looks unfamiliar.

392
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:17,167
Have I...

393
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,467
ever borrowed money from you?

394
00:25:23,433 --> 00:25:26,933
Or bought vinyl flooring?

395
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:29,100
Flooring...

396
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:33,067
If neither...

397
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:34,300
Then you're worse.

398
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,333
Oh, my.

399
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,400
Unnie.

400
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,800
You got a sharp tongue, huh?

401
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,567
Walk slowly!

402
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:44,467
You'll hurt your joints.

403
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:15,800
- Kids, let's go.
- I made this myself. Share it with Dong Min.

404
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,633
Miss, Miss.

405
00:26:17,633 --> 00:26:19,300
We'll head in first now.

406
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,633
- Going home?
- Yes.

407
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:21,867
Ah, okay.

408
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:24,267
- Did you have fun?
- Let's go.

409
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:26,567
Miss.

410
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:30,133
You know how grateful we are that you came, right?

411
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:32,633
Miss.

412
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,467
Please take good care of our kids from now on.

413
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:38,467
Please look after our Jenny
and Seo Hyeon too, Miss.

414
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:40,333
Thank you for the meal today.

415
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,400
We'll head back now.

416
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,800
Yes, go home quickly.

417
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
- We'll be going in.
- Okay.

418
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,467
- Thank you.
- Go on inside.

419
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:46,900
- Goodbye.
- I'll go in now.

420
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,600
- Please go in.
- Goodbye.

421
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:52,400
Jeon Dong Min.

422
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,200
Seems like you've got competition now?

423
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,933
What do you mean?

424
00:26:58,067 --> 00:27:02,700
Who in Muchang could stand up
to Seong Tae so confidently?

425
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,800
Actually, everyone here is tied to
Seong Tae through interests,

426
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,333
so they say 'yes' even when they hate it.

427
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:14,767
She's truly an unpredictable person.

428
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,267
Look at this.

429
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,733
The village chief gave me this before leaving.

430
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:22,900
Let's have one more drink.

431
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,267
Sis, you should drink with us too.

432
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:27,100
You guys drink among yourselves.

433
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,800
I have to close up the shop.

434
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,833
Oh my, Hae Na.

435
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:33,500
Mom drank too much, so I can't carry you home.

436
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,367
Alright, let's go home and sleep.

437
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:38,233
My daughter, can you walk?

438
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:40,733
- Go carefully, sis.
- Yeah, I'm going.

439
00:27:40,733 --> 00:27:42,000
Goodnight, Uncle.

440
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,900
- Goodbye, Hae Na.
- Bye.

441
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,533
Oh, Miss, goodbye.

442
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,133
Let's go.

443
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:57,467
Ms. Hye Ji.

444
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,367
What?

445
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:03,933
How about we share a glass
of ginseng liquor together?

446
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:06,133
Speaking of this ginseng liquor,

447
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:08,533
since it's made with six-year-old ginseng roots,

448
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:11,533
just one sip will make your body temperature...

449
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:13,000
This, it's really good.

450
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,667
Your temperature spikes?

451
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:19,067
Can't do that.

452
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:20,067
Huh?

453
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:24,200
Because if I get cute,

454
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,900
it'll be a big problem.

455
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,067
Can't do that.

456
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:28,467
No, I can't...

457
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:29,500
That would be dangerous.

458
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,900
- That's really dangerous.
- I'm in danger.

459
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,667
I can't resist cute things.

460
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:34,667
I can't handle cute stuff at all.

461
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:37,233
You're already cute enough.
What's with making it worse?

462
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:40,833
- You're dangerous.
- Dangerous things are bad.

463
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:41,967
Shall we open it?

464
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:43,267
- Shall we open it?
- Shall we?

465
00:28:43,267 --> 00:28:44,900
Wait.

466
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
- Why? Please.
- Wait a second, friend.

467
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,500
You seem way too drunk right now.

468
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,133
- No.
- We'll go in first.

469
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:52,467
We're too tired.

470
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:53,800
It seems like she's in good condition.

471
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,867
No, Yeong Ran.

472
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:58,767
- Feeling sick?
- I'm just...

473
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:00,967
Today, I'm just going to...

474
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,167
I'll try being cute.

475
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,333
You are gonna get all cute.

476
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:12,167
You are gonna get all cute.

477
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:14,800
You are gonna get all cute.

478
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,367
- Like it?
- Like it.

479
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:17,400
I like it.

480
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,733
- You're really...
- Me?

481
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:22,067
- You're dead.
- I'm dead, really?

482
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:26,233
Her friend's so cute. She's my ideal type.

483
00:29:26,233 --> 00:29:28,200
She's cute?

484
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,767
Go home and sleep.

485
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,867
I'm going to put Ju Won to sleep.

486
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:35,900
And take care of her when you come in.

487
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,933
Her mouth's going numb.

488
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:38,300
Why?

489
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,267
Her mouth is already going numb.

490
00:29:41,267 --> 00:29:43,333
Take off your wig before sleeping.

491
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:45,433
Not taking it off to sleep?

492
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:48,533
By the way, my friend!

493
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:52,833
What's the Muchang strawberry guy like?

494
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:56,000
Back in Seoul I couldn't even speak to him.

495
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,367
He's the most dangerous person in Muchang.

496
00:29:59,933 --> 00:30:02,300
So you should be careful too, Baek Hye Ji.

497
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:09,867
I knew he was dangerous.

498
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,167
He's super lethal.

499
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:23,433
Berry, berry, strawberry pie.

500
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:51,100
I've never used this before.

501
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,067
But this thing

502
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:59,067
can pierce someone's skull.

503
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:00,900
Right, Ms. Kim So Yeong?

504
00:31:03,133 --> 00:31:05,033
I don't know about that.

505
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:08,233
What exactly do you want, Vice President?

506
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,667
I keep asking you, right?

507
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:17,267
Who got you two jobs?

508
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:18,267
At our factory.

509
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:20,133
How many times do I have to tell you?

510
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:23,567
A lawyer came and told me
to do this or go to prison.

511
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:26,200
Wasn't it Kim Yeong Ran?

512
00:31:28,133 --> 00:31:30,033
Do you like Yeong Ran?

513
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:34,433
Why keep looking for Yeong Ran since earlier?

514
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:38,000
You two aren't involved, are you?

515
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,300
Not me, but with my father.

516
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:42,967
If it's your father...

517
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:44,600
Darn it.

518
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,000
Are you genuinely asking because you don't know?

519
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,467
I'm asking because I don't know!

520
00:31:48,467 --> 00:31:52,633
Your darn daughter Kim Yeong Ran
married Chairman Ga Sung Ho.

521
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:55,933
Haven't you seen the news?

522
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:57,600
Oh my.

523
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,933
Was this my lottery jackpot?

524
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:01,700
That's insane!

525
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,933
That gold digger?

526
00:32:02,933 --> 00:32:04,167
Oh goodness.

527
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:06,067
How can a mother call her daughter a gold digger?

528
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:08,067
Ugh, seriously...

529
00:32:08,067 --> 00:32:11,933
Everyone calls her that. Why shouldn't I?

530
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:15,533
But if my daughter's Chairman Ga Sung Ho's wife,

531
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,533
then you and I are now...

532
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,933
In-laws?

533
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:24,233
In-laws?

534
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:27,467
If Yeong Ran's his mother,

535
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:30,567
you and him aren't in-laws.

536
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:33,000
It's grandson and grandmother.

537
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,600
Legally speaking.

538
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:37,100
Oh.

539
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,767
Right.

540
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,000
In-laws, yep.

541
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:43,933
In-laws.

542
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:46,033
You really don't know where your daughter is?

543
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:49,067
- Grandmother.
- Darn it.

544
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:52,200
Didn't you chaebols even investigate that?

545
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,100
I cut ties with Yeong Ran long ago.

546
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,667
How is it that these things are the same
for both wealthy and poor families?

547
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,367
Right, in-law?

548
00:33:04,033 --> 00:33:05,667
Exactly.

549
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,433
In-law buddy.

550
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:13,767
I might find out where Yeong Ran is.

551
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:15,233
You know how?

552
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:17,000
If there's a way?

553
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,433
Then what will you do for me?

554
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,667
Wait, in-law.

555
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:28,000
Trying to profit by selling your daughter?

556
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,667
Since family's asking to find her,

557
00:33:31,633 --> 00:33:34,633
I might help a little.

558
00:33:34,633 --> 00:33:36,867
Right? Between us?

559
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:41,167
That's right.

560
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:43,000
That much is possible between us.

561
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,933
But, in-law.

562
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:48,233
Huh?

563
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:50,167
Why are you suddenly

564
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:55,867
using informal language and causing a fuss?

565
00:33:57,633 --> 00:34:01,000
You really make me want to kill you.

566
00:34:07,033 --> 00:34:10,133
Hey, get someone to follow Lee Don.

567
00:34:11,567 --> 00:34:13,300
Hey.

568
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,967
You watch him.

569
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:48,200
What are you doing now?

570
00:34:48,867 --> 00:34:51,833
We still haven't
finished our talk yesterday, right?

571
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,533
What about?

572
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,533
We talked about everything yesterday.

573
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:57,933
What exactly did we talk about?

574
00:34:57,933 --> 00:34:59,967
You know, when I pushed you.

575
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:02,067
You want to discuss that now?

576
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,433
You're heading to the greenhouse, right?

577
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:05,167
Let's finish talking there.

578
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:06,633
What?

579
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:08,400
Not leaving?

580
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,233
Miss.

581
00:35:30,433 --> 00:35:34,467
Please listen and don't misunderstand.

582
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,700
I genuinely have no interest in you.

583
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,733
That's why I said it meant nothing.

584
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:43,667
But I'm actually interested in you.

585
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:45,333
What?

586
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:48,733
Is that truly the reason?

587
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:49,900
Yes.

588
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,333
Because you doubt me too much.

589
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:55,533
So you tried to kiss me?

590
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:58,167
Kiss? When did I?

591
00:35:58,167 --> 00:36:00,067
You were trying to use money
to win people's hearts,

592
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:01,800
and since money doesn't work on me,

593
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,767
you tried to use your looks

594
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:06,367
and approached me yesterday.

595
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,100
I see how you might think that way.

596
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,267
Well, Ju Won's father,

597
00:36:21,267 --> 00:36:23,900
you seem deeply mistaken about something.

598
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,100
Since you kept blocking my path,

599
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,667
I instinctively pushed you in panic.

600
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:32,133
You should've just said that.

601
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:35,200
I didn't know you would
misunderstand it this much.

602
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,533
You have a kid, and yet you're surprisingly naive.

603
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:43,200
Not naive, just honest.

604
00:36:47,933 --> 00:36:51,233
So, all misunderstandings are cleared?

605
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,567
We're at the greenhouse.

606
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,167
Wow.

607
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:07,167
[Muchang Residents' Relationship Chart]

608
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:09,000
What's this?

609
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:13,233
But why is Berry Boy an 'extra'?

610
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,433
He's the main character.

611
00:37:38,233 --> 00:37:39,833
Huh?

612
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:10,200
She locked all of this too?

613
00:38:11,733 --> 00:38:13,400
000.

614
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,833
No.

615
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,467
Oh, come on.

616
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,600
Wow!

617
00:38:50,467 --> 00:38:52,167
What is it?

618
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,267
Jeez.

619
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:31,033
Ah, be careful when picking them.

620
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:32,733
They wilt fast if the stems fall off.

621
00:39:32,733 --> 00:39:34,533
And it lowers their market value.

622
00:39:36,867 --> 00:39:38,633
Oh, this.

623
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:41,700
You owe me 10,000 won.

624
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:44,867
Then I'll pay you back now.

625
00:39:44,867 --> 00:39:46,967
I hate owing people more than
anything in this world.

626
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:50,433
Oh, you're not letting me speak.

627
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:02,000
Isn't it hard for you to raise Ju Won alone?

628
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,633
Me?

629
00:40:04,933 --> 00:40:06,867
Well, I...

630
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:10,167
I want to be like a greenhouse for Ju Won.

631
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:13,067
What do you mean by that?

632
00:40:13,067 --> 00:40:17,967
Strawberries are sensitive
to temperature and humidity.

633
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:20,867
But this greenhouse stands firm,

634
00:40:20,867 --> 00:40:23,067
blocking rain, wind, and cold.

635
00:40:23,067 --> 00:40:25,000
It protects them from all that.

636
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,833
Feels secure, doesn't it?

637
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,333
Ju Won's lucky

638
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:34,967
to have a father like you.

639
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,900
Miss.

640
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,567
I'm sorry for misunderstanding you earlier.

641
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:51,033
You didn't even take the money Seong Tae offered.

642
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:53,067
Never seen anyone refuse that.

643
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:56,067
It's only 3 million won, after all.

644
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:58,967
3 million won isn't going to change my life.

645
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,833
Wow.

646
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:06,300
Even though you speak so annoyingly,

647
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,433
you seem to have a good heart.

648
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:21,533
Alright.

649
00:41:21,533 --> 00:41:23,733
I think we've had enough.

650
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:25,600
Let's go have breakfast.

651
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:32,333
Is 50,000 won enough for this?

652
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:33,967
Come on.

653
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:36,633
Solving everything with money

654
00:41:36,633 --> 00:41:38,533
doesn't work on me.

655
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:39,833
Eat that as dessert.

656
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,467
Here.

657
00:41:55,767 --> 00:41:57,567
Why?

658
00:41:57,567 --> 00:41:59,733
Changed your mind?

659
00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:01,533
Should I give you money?

660
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,533
No.

661
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,133
Let's go.

662
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:23,833
When did you get that scar?

663
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,633
Scar?

664
00:42:25,633 --> 00:42:27,667
There's a scar on your wrist.

665
00:42:29,733 --> 00:42:31,833
This isn't a scar.

666
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:37,933
Oh, everyone has a scar or two, right?

667
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:42,200
Lower your shirt now.

668
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,300
Nice abs, by the way.

669
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:47,767
I wasn't showing them off.

670
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,900
Sis, what's going on this morning?

671
00:42:59,867 --> 00:43:01,633
Is something good happening?

672
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,733
Seon Woo.

673
00:43:07,733 --> 00:43:09,700
Did you find Kim So Yeong?

674
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,800
How did you know?

675
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,633
Sis.

676
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:22,333
I'm working hard to catch Kim Yeong Ran.

677
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,133
I'll bring her to you. Don't worry.

678
00:43:28,133 --> 00:43:30,067
<i>Is having a child just for show?</i>

679
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:32,233
<i>You'll quit after having a kid.
Why take parental leave?</i>

680
00:43:32,233 --> 00:43:33,467
<i>Quit now!</i>

681
00:43:33,467 --> 00:43:36,100
<i>I said quit!</i>

682
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,833
Ga Seon Woo.

683
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:41,600
Sis.

684
00:43:44,033 --> 00:43:45,867
This is...

685
00:43:45,867 --> 00:43:48,133
Not a single word you said was wrong.

686
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:49,900
Is having a baby just a show?

687
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,900
I also don't like how anyone
and everyone takes maternity leave,

688
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,033
gives birth, and quits,
causing harm to the company.

689
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:58,133
I hate it too.

690
00:43:58,133 --> 00:43:59,600
Right?

691
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,700
I did good, didn't I?

692
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,833
- Seon Woo.
- Yeah.

693
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,433
I always say,

694
00:44:12,433 --> 00:44:15,367
'Don't show your true self

695
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:18,900
to those idiots.'

696
00:44:26,567 --> 00:44:27,833
Sis.

697
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,267
Sis, I get it.

698
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:31,333
I'll take care of this right away, okay?

699
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:34,400
Hey, get this done through the secretary's office.

700
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,033
It's done, right?

701
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,567
If you let pigs disrespect you,
you become one. Understood?

702
00:44:43,467 --> 00:44:45,267
Answer.

703
00:44:45,267 --> 00:44:46,700
Okay.

704
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,333
I'll really follow your advice now.

705
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,967
Seon Woo.

706
00:44:52,967 --> 00:44:55,400
Cancel the party and starve for three days.

707
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,233
Don't shave. Apologize publicly looking haggard.

708
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:00,733
Understand?

709
00:45:00,733 --> 00:45:02,000
Okay.

710
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,400
I always listen to everything you say, sis.

711
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,433
- Follow me.
- Huh?

712
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:22,167
- Yes?
- Attorney Lee Don?

713
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:23,167
Yeah, that's me.

714
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:24,800
We are the police.

715
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,000
I don't need an introduction, I know.

716
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,767
You're under urgent arrest
for embezzlement charges.

717
00:45:32,767 --> 00:45:36,800
Embezzlement. How cliché.

718
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,333
Huh? Vice Chairman!

719
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:44,167
I saw that your video is popular online.

720
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:45,633
Congratulations.

721
00:45:45,633 --> 00:45:46,900
Congratulations?

722
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,500
Ga Seon Woo!

723
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:52,433
What brings you here this early?

724
00:45:52,433 --> 00:45:55,567
You didn't come out of concern for me, did you?

725
00:45:55,567 --> 00:45:57,467
Are you here to watch me get arrested?

726
00:45:57,467 --> 00:45:59,300
To warn you.

727
00:46:00,067 --> 00:46:02,100

01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:59,233
<i>♫ I share the light ♫</i>

1082
01:06:59,233 --> 01:07:06,000
<i>♫ I'll brighten the days shrouded in darkness ♫</i>

1083
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,033
<i>♫ It's not over ♫</i>

1084
01:07:08,033 --> 01:07:16,467
<i>♫ The present isn't bound by the past ♫</i>

1085
01:07:16,467 --> 01:07:22,333
<i>♫ Come back to me safely ♫</i>

1086
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:28,133
<i>♫ So I'm, I'm alive ♫</i>

1087
01:07:29,733 --> 01:07:33,833
<i>♫ From the untouchable darkness ♫</i>

1088
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:39,400
<i>♫ Starting to be born again ♫</i>

1089
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:44,700
<i>♫ For the new me about to begin ♫</i>

1090
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:50,533
<i>♫ I want to sail away ♫</i>

1091
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:52,033
<i>♫ Again ♫</i>

1092
01:07:52,033 --> 01:07:53,833
<i>♫ Show you better ♫</i>

1093
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:54,967
<i>♫ Enclose the letters of the past ♫</i>

1094
01:07:54,967 --> 01:07:56,733
Jeon Dong Min knows my true identity.

1095
01:07:56,733 --> 01:07:58,100
Are you afraid I'll say something?

1096
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,033
She's just someone who only stayed at school.

1097
01:08:00,033 --> 01:08:01,633
What does he know about management?

1098
01:08:01,633 --> 01:08:03,333
You want me to expose this?

1099
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:05,233
We didn't recognize a tiger cub, did we?

1100
01:08:05,233 --> 01:08:07,033
You're terrified of your sister, aren't you?

1101
01:08:07,033 --> 01:08:08,933
What exactly do you two want?

1102
01:08:08,933 --> 01:08:10,867
I love this place.

1103
01:08:10,867 --> 01:08:12,800
I'll make sure you two rot in jail.

1104
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,833
Ms. Bu Se Mi got arrested.

1105
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:15,900
No, background check.

1106
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:16,933
Oh, Lord.

1107
01:08:16,933 --> 01:08:19,767
Let's go. Search every possible spot.

1108
01:08:19,767 --> 01:08:21,400
Hey, get down!

1109
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,533
I'll leave Muchang.
