Everyone ran away while I was asleep.

My mom, my dad,

184
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,333
and even ex-boyfriend.

185
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,800
I won't run.

186
00:12:56,967 --> 00:13:01,267
If you do, tell me first, okay?

187
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:04,600
Okay.

188
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,967
Promise me.

189
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:13,067
Copy.

190
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,933
Friend.

191
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:24,167
You know Berry Berry Boy.

192
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:28,667
He's handsome, fit,

193
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,033
and though he seems cold,

194
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:36,367
he's actually really thoughtful
when you look closely.

195
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:41,933
He seems like the kind of guy
you could plan a future with, right?

196
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,133
You noticed all that in such a short time.

197
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:51,900
Friend, want to stay here
and grow strawberries with me?

198
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,967
Put down roots here like these strawberries.

199
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:04,100
<i>Strawberries are sensitive
to temperature and humidity.</i>

200
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,067
<i>But this greenhouse stands firm,</i>

201
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:09,000
<i>blocking rain, wind, and cold.</i>

202
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,267
<i>It protects them from all that.</i>

203
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,100
<i>Feels secure, doesn't it?</i>

204
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:17,067
How could a person put down roots?

205
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:19,367
We're not strawberries.

206
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,967
And we don't have any soil

207
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:28,733
or greenhouse to protect us.

Where are you going?

210
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:47,933
You know me.

211
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:51,200
Around this time of year,
I always go to Hawaii to catch some sun.

212

- Keep up the...
- Wait a second.

213

Stay in Korea for now.

214

Why?

215
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,367
Is my sister still furious?

216
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:05,967
Yes.

217
00:15:06,633 --> 00:15:07,733
Get in.

218
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,567
Got it.

219
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:13,633
I said I got it.

220
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,433
Just get in.

221
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:20,833
Don't make a scene.

222
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,267
- I said I got it.
- Huh?

223
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:23,900
I got it.

224
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,300

You really didn't run away?

227
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:43,667
I told you escaping isn't an option.

228
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:46,067
Are you going to expose who I am?

229
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:51,333
You still don't trust me.

231
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:11,133
I got really close with Ms. Hye Ji yesterday.

232
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:13,033
Yeah, you mentioned that yesterday.

233
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:16,733
Oh, but Ms. Hye Ji kept

234
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:19,133
asking questions about you.

235
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:23,733
Like who Ju Won's mom is, where she is...

236
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,633
And?

237
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:27,767
So, um...

238
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:30,667
I said Ju Won's mom left you
for a rich guy and is living happily now.

239
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:33,100
Told her not to get any ideas about you.

Tae Min.

241
00:16:35,933 --> 00:16:38,067
Did I say something wrong again?

242
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:39,733
Jeez, forget it.

243
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,600
Don't fall for Baek Hye Ji.

244
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,033
Wait, are you into her?

245
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:48,333
I'm not interested at all.

246
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,533
Ms. Baek Hye Ji

247
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:53,133
doesn't seem interested in you at all.

248
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:56,133
So don't waste your time and energy on her.

249
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:57,533
She could leave any day, man.

250
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,667
Oh, Miss. What brings you here?

251
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:00,833
Hello.

252
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,233
I came to help pick strawberries.

253
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:03,567
That's so kind.

254
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:04,800
Here, use this one.

255
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,333
- I can grab a new one.
- It's fine.

256
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,067
Really, it's okay.

257
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,300
Are you afraid I'll say something?

258
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,600
I can't deny that.

259
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,067
I told you, I won't say anything.

260
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,967
Wow, Miss. You're great at picking strawberries.

261
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:23,633
I tend to pick things up quickly once I learn.

262
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:26,167
You're a genius. A genius!

263
00:17:28,367 --> 00:17:29,967
Huh?

264
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:39,367
A vice president runs the company into the ground,

265
00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:42,133
and Vice President Ga Seon Woo

266
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:43,933
is trying to sell shares to a Chinese firm.

267
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:47,367
This could lead to legal issues.
He might lose his executive position.

268
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,200
Then who should we appoint as CEO?

269
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Director Ga Seon Yeong
has only worked at the university.

270
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,767
What does she know about management?

271
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:57,733
But she's the founder's descendant.

272
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,600
By that logic, the widow also qualifies.

273
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,733
[Kim Dong Wook]
She's bound to become the largest shareholder.

[Park Yong Guk]

275
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:07,833
Even the stubborn Chairman Ga
is helpless around women.

276
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,767
Director Park, did you really not know?

277
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:17,533
Director Ga called for this meeting
but hasn't come yet?

278
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,267
Professor Ga Seon Yeong

279
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:26,033
informed us she can't attend
today's board meeting.

280
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:27,033
Unbelievable.

281
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:30,600
Someone from academia
breaking schedules like this?

282
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,667
Jeez.

283
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:36,400
And the press conference originally scheduled
for tomorrow has been moved up to today at 2 p.m.

284
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,600
Who changed it? Vice President Ga Seon Woo?

285
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,233

<i>is the future of our Gaseong Group...</i>

290

They are all speaking so carelessly
like it's someone else's company.

291
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:04,500
Everyone all acted like loyal subordinates
in front of Ga Sung Ho.

00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,900
Where's Seon Woo?

293
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,200
He's confined to a Gangwon-do resort with guards.

00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,000

I'm Ga Seon Yeong.

297

Did I surprise you?

298
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,667
You're here to see me because of the article
about Vice President Ga Seon Woo, right?

299
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:45,000
I can't reveal my sources.

300
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,767
That's the journalist's principle.

301
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,267
That's why I looked into you,

302
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:51,333
but my purpose today

303
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,300
isn't about that.

304
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:58,500
I have some information to share with you too.

305
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,900
Seon Woo might have his flaws,
but he's not a bad person.

306
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:07,267
At today's press conference, he's going to
step down from Gaseong Group management.

Then what exactly is this document?

308
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,133
Documents regarding Gaseong Group's board members.

309
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:15,333
Though Gaseong Group thrived
thanks to the Korean Wave trend,

310
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,033
there were many internal issues.

311
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:19,967
You'll understand once you review them.

312
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:28,000
In our family, I yielded my position
to Seon Woo simply because I'm a woman,

313
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,800
but now I want to lead
Gaseong Group with integrity.

You want me to break this story?

315

The essence of journalism
is objectivity, isn't it?

316

I don't think you released that recording
to harm Gaseong Group

317

or to make Seon Woo look bad.

318
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:47,633
I believe you did it out of professional integrity
because you believe in

319
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:50,200
your mission as a journalist, to reveal the truth.

320
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,933
Am I wrong?

separately from our side.

this story wide open.

believe in journalistic principles

00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,967
Dong Min.

362
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:26,300
Isn't there anything we can do
at your strawberry house?

363
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,967
Our operation isn't that big,

364
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:31,600
so Tae Min alone can handle it.

365
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,533
Hye Ji, you should come too.

366
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,400
Why? Miss used to come help
with the early morning work, right?

367
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,867
Friend.

368
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:46,867
Want to teach ballet at our kindergarten?

369
00:24:46,867 --> 00:24:48,333
Oh no, that's nonsense.

370
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,133
Come on.

371
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:56,067
No, that's okay.

372
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:57,167
Shall I show you again now?

373
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:59,900
No need... Just focus on your meal at the table.

374
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,400
Hurry up and eat.

375
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Eat up.

376
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,033
What are you doing? Why are you like this?

377
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:08,233
No.

378
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:15,533
This isn't acceptable.

379
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:17,300
This is absolutely not acceptable.

380
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,167
Miss, even if you're friends,
you can't just ask me to hire anyone.

381
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,600
I can't do that.

382
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,033
Look, the kindergarten
has financial problems, and also...

383
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:29,100
Don't worry about finances.

384
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,933
I'll cover Ms. Baek Hye Ji's salary myself.

385
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:33,167
Miss, why are you really doing this?

386
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:35,333
Did you do anything wrong to...

387
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,533
Principal.

388
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:38,300
Mr. Jeon Dong Min

389
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,900
discovered my true identity.

390
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:44,433
Why were you so careless?

391
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:46,000
If everyone who knows my true identity

392
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,967
remains within my sight,
I can keep them under control.

393
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:50,800
I need to ask you a favor.

394
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:55,833
Yes.

395
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,633
I guess there's no choice.

396
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,167
Our dear Ms. Bu Se Mi.

397
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:04,300
I see what you mean.

398
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:08,167
Sit.

399
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:10,067
That's right.

400
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:11,700
Wait.

401
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,733
Sit.

402
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:18,233
There you go. Good.

403
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:20,033
Dong Min, I heard

404
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:21,433
you found out Ms. Bu's true identity.

405
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:22,533
So what did you get in return

406
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:25,333
for keeping her real identity a secret?

407
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,667
Money? Land? Or...

408
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,700
Oh, so you did make a deal?

409
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,500
No, no.

410
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,333
You trust me, right?

411
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,733
I didn't start this. She proposed it first.

412
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:39,333
Trust me.

413
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,900
I need to go to the restroom.

414
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,867
What? That makes it even weirder.

415
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:49,500
Good morning, everyone.

416
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,200
Hello, Miss.

417
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,900
You look beautiful as always today.

418
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,900
Miss, did you dream about me?

419
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,800
No wonder, I had a really good dream.

420
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,500
You'll ride in my car, right?

421
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,133
I even have ginger tea in it, Miss.

422
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:06,200
Ah, I already agreed to ride with Dong Min.

423
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,233
Maybe next time, thanks.

424
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:09,367
Hello, Dong Min.

425
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:10,467
Have a nice day.

426
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:13,167
- Yes.
- Good work today.

427
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:19,133
You said you were going with me?

428
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,833
Are you spying on me? Are you afraid I'll tell?

429
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:24,367
'I don't need money or anything else.'

430
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:26,100
How am I supposed to trust someone who says that?

431
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,433
Then what will make you trust me?

432
00:27:27,433 --> 00:27:29,067
We'll figure that out over time.
For now, let's go.

433
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:30,967
We'll be late for kindergarten.

434
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:47,300
<i>Recent exposes about Gaseong Group Vice President
Ga Seon Woo's abuse of power and corruption</i>

435
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,967
<i>have sparked nationwide boycotts
of Gaseong Ramyeon products.</i>

436
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:53,167
<i>Vice President Ga Seon Woo is suspected of</i>

437
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:56,400
<i>trying to manipulate stock prices
by mobilizing certain forces...</i>

438
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,033
Ju Won's been so rebellious lately. Never listens.

439
00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:05,033
Seven-year-olds are terrifying.

440
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,033
Don't try to change the subject.

441
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:10,233
I check the news daily.

442
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:18,233
I don't know much about chaebols,

443
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:22,367
but if stock prices are affected,
wouldn't people get more sensitive?

444
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,233
That's how it's shown in dramas.

445
00:28:24,233 --> 00:28:28,400
This is my first time dealing
with something like this too, so I'm not sure yet.

446
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,400
I wasn't great at math back in school.

447
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,867
Were you good at it?

448
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:40,633
Of course I wasn't.

449
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,767
Thought so.

450
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:50,300
Enjoy your meal.

451
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,333
Thank you for the food.

452
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,767
I hate carrots.

453
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,767
Carrots are a secret.

454
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:11,367
Secret.

455
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,367
Miss, let's have snacks and play hair salon.

456
00:29:18,367 --> 00:29:19,833
Alright.

457
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:22,833
[Baek Hye Ji's Resume]

458
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:27,033
You really had the elite path, huh?

459
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:30,000
Is this Iseon Kids or what?

460
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,100
Oh, Lord.

461
00:29:35,367 --> 00:29:36,967
Ms. Baek Hye Ji.

462
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:41,467
Let's skip formalities. We both know the truth.

463
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:49,567
That's exactly what I wanted, Principal.

464
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,667
Since when have you known Madam's name?

465
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,500
Since she came into Chairman Ga's household.

466
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,300
Oh, so not very long then.

467
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,667
It's longer than your time.

468
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:02,633
Didn't know that, did you?

469
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:05,700
In relationships, what's
more important than how long?

470
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,100
Depth. It's about depth.

471
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,833
What do you want from Madam?

472
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,500
Me?

473
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,900
I want to eat together and watch movies.

474
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:17,800
But you,

475
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:22,233
here talk about emotional depth,

476
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:23,933
yet want something else, huh?

477
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:25,333
No, no, no.

478
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:27,633
What 'something else'?

479
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:29,067
I'm just trying to show

480
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:32,933
that Madam and I have a somewhat

481
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:36,867
special relationship, that's important.

482
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,233
Do you think Madam sees it that way too?

483
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:47,000
Huh?

484
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,567
- I'm the prince.
- What?

485
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:50,067
I said I'm the prince.

486
00:30:50,067 --> 00:30:52,000
What's this sound?

487
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,833
What's this sound?

488
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:58,867
- I'm the prince.
- I'm telling you, I'm the prince.

489
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:02,500
- Go away.
- No! I'm the prince!

490
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,000
- I'm the prince.
- I'll add another one.

491
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,633
Yes.

492
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:12,833
You look pretty. Now you're a princess.

493
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:13,867
Yeah?

494
00:31:13,867 --> 00:31:15,267
- I'm the prince.
- I'm telling you, I'm the prince.

495
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:16,433
Strawberry class.

496
00:31:16,433 --> 00:31:18,200
Everyone focus. Quiet!

497
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
Quiet! Quiet!

498
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,833
Oh, my.

499
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,667
Ms. Bu Se Mi became a princess.

500
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:26,667
Pretty, right?

501
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:27,767
So pretty.

502
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:30,900
- Yes.
- Wow, friend.

503
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,833
The crown's really beautiful.

504
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,067
No! Construction! Dangerous! Principal! Principal!

505
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:41,867
Thank you. Thank you.

506
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:44,133
What's happening?

507
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,833
What are you doing right now?

508
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:02,400
What are you doing? Wait, this is...

509
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,533
Oh my, what...

510
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:07,133
What are you doing right now?

511
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,033
The landowner

512
00:32:09,033 --> 00:32:11,867
asked us to dig here
along the yellow line on this map.

513
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:15,267
Sir, this is a kindergarten.

514
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,100
Jeez.

515
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,433
Can't you see the children?

516
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,700
We're just doing what we were told.

517
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,867
Kang Seong Tae!

518
00:32:28,867 --> 00:32:30,733
I'll kill this punk!

519
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:31,867
Huh? Hey!

520
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,667
You! What are you doing? You!

521
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:35,700
Oh, my.

522
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,933
Wait, this is...

523
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:39,267
- Oh my, friend.
- Principal.

524
00:32:41,633 --> 00:32:43,267
Friend!

525
00:32:43,267 --> 00:32:44,633
Are you okay?

526
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:47,000
Madam... I mean, Ms. Bu Se Mi.

527
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,733
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

528
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,600
Principal and teachers should go that way.

529
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,700
Go quickly.

530
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,400
- Take care of the children first.
- Kids first.

531
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Follow your teacher.

532
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,633
Come on kids, I'll take you.

533
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:06,067
Hey, stop!

534
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,400
You just touched my stuff, huh? Huh?

535
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,800
You're both trespassing on my land.

536
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,933
- Film this.
- Got it.

537
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,667
Stop filming.

538
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:19,733
No, keep filming.

539
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:22,300
Restore this first.

540
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,567
What if the kids get hurt while playing here?

541
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:26,033
Then don't let them play here.

908
00:55:12,967 --> 00:55:14,367
What are you doing?

909
00:55:14,367 --> 00:55:16,233
Hey!

910
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:17,433
Grab her.

911
00:55:17,433 --> 00:55:18,800
Stay there. Hey!

912
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,267
- Get down.
- Get down!

913
00:55:20,267 --> 00:55:21,867
Hey!

914
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,167
They are following us.

915
00:55:44,767 --> 00:55:47,133
Come on, hurry up!

916
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:57,000
Step on it harder!

917
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,933
Get out now.

918
00:56:50,733 --> 00:56:52,933
I said get out!

919
00:56:53,667 --> 00:56:55,000
What are you doing?

920
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,067
Ah, jeez.

921
00:56:57,067 --> 00:57:00,133
Miss, just stay here.

922
00:57:08,128 --> 00:57:09,633
Darn.

923
00:57:09,633 --> 00:57:11,633
What are you guys?

924
00:57:11,633 --> 00:57:13,133
You get lost.

925
00:57:13,133 --> 00:57:14,533
Kim Yeong Ran.

926
00:57:14,533 --> 00:57:17,400
Let's handle this peacefully, okay?

927
00:57:21,333 --> 00:57:23,600
I said let's go.

928
00:58:11,367 --> 00:58:12,433
What are you doing?

929
00:58:12,433 --> 00:58:13,867
Hey, you go.

930
00:58:13,867 --> 00:58:15,633
You finish this. Huh?

931
00:58:15,633 --> 00:58:17,300
1 billion won.

932
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,100
2 billion won.

933
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:22,533
I'll give you 2 billion won.
Hurry up and finish it off. I'm hungry.

934
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:25,167
2 billion won? Okay.

935
00:58:45,033 --> 00:58:46,667
Are you insane?

936
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,600
What the heck?

937
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:10,833
Let's go too.

938
00:59:11,733 --> 00:59:12,967
Quickly, quickly.

939
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:14,633
- Darn it.
- Boss.

940
00:59:14,633 --> 00:59:16,267
Hey, run.

941
00:59:37,867 --> 00:59:40,267
Mr. Jeon Dong Min, I'm sorry.

942
00:59:40,267 --> 00:59:44,367
I didn't realize others
might get hurt because of me.

943
00:59:44,367 --> 00:59:46,500
I'll leave Muchang.

944
00:59:56,267 --> 00:59:58,133
What are you doing?

945
01:00:08,167 --> 01:00:09,200
What is this place?

946
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,200
<i>Re-routing due to deviation from path.</i>

947
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,733
This stupid GPS isn't working!

948
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,133
Come on.

949
01:00:22,133 --> 01:00:24,167
Darn it.

950
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,233
No!

951
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,667
This is Moodeave.

952
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:09,633
Muchang's Maldives.

953
01:01:11,767 --> 01:01:13,933
Only I call it that.

954
01:01:13,933 --> 01:01:16,833
Coming here clears my mind.

955
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:20,067
Oh, but there's no mojito.

956
01:01:20,067 --> 01:01:22,033
I'll bring some next time.

957
01:01:24,933 --> 01:01:26,967
Don't overdo it.

958
01:01:30,067 --> 01:01:31,667
Miss.

959
01:01:32,633 --> 01:01:34,900
Are you really going to leave Muchang?

960
01:01:43,733 --> 01:01:46,400
When you, Chairman Ga Sung Ho's wife, came down,

961
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,000
you changed your name and identity
to avoid the bereaved,

962
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,500
you didn't come here
for some getaway or healing, right?

963
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,267
In Muchang,

964
01:01:58,633 --> 01:02:00,800
please stay as Ms. Bu Se Mi.

965
01:02:04,467 --> 01:02:08,733
Ju Won likes you more than anyone.

966
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,900
You said sorrow doesn't halve when shared,

967
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,967
but it becomes a weakness, right?

968
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,567
I'll protect you,

969
01:02:22,967 --> 01:02:25,167
so it won't become a weakness.

970
01:02:26,067 --> 01:02:28,000
No matter what happens.

971
01:02:30,233 --> 01:02:32,967
Why are you protecting me?

972
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,067
And how can I trust your words?

973
01:02:37,067 --> 01:02:40,300
Wow, you really don't trust people.

974
01:02:41,067 --> 01:02:43,900
Should we make a written contract?

975
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:53,900
I'll take your silence as agreement.

976
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:52,900
Want to try it too, Miss?

977
01:05:01,233 --> 01:05:02,467
Kim So Yeong?

978
01:05:02,467 --> 01:05:04,433
Oh, jeez.

979
01:05:07,033 --> 01:05:09,067
This young brat...

980
01:05:09,067 --> 01:05:12,133
How dare you call elders by name?

981
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,233
Secretary Ham.

982
01:05:19,233 --> 01:05:20,867
Yes, Professor.

983
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,533
Tell Lee Don.

984
01:05:24,933 --> 01:05:27,400
If Kim Yeong Ran doesn't show up,

985
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,167
we'll kill her mother.

986
01:05:30,167 --> 01:05:31,900
Understood.

987
01:05:53,133 --> 01:05:56,133
<i>♫ Now is the time ♫</i>

988
01:05:56,133 --> 01:06:04,167
<i>♫ Even hidden scars will shine ♫</i>

989
01:06:04,167 --> 01:06:07,300
<i>♫ I share the light ♫</i>

990
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:14,067
<i>♫ I'll brighten the days shrouded in darkness ♫</i>

991
01:06:14,067 --> 01:06:16,067
<i>♫ It's not over ♫</i>

992
01:06:16,067 --> 01:06:21,200
<i>♫ The present isn't bound by the past ♫</i>

993
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,367
If you decide to leave,

994
01:06:23,367 --> 01:06:24,733
please tell me first.

995
01:06:24,733 --> 01:06:27,667
We have a visitor.

996
01:06:27,667 --> 01:06:29,100
Ms. Bu Se Mi.

997
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:30,233
My daughter!

998
01:06:30,233 --> 01:06:31,667
How did you get here?

999
01:06:31,667 --> 01:06:34,400
Shouldn't you repay my care?

1000
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,500
It's been a while.

1001
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,233
I called you for a favor.

1002
01:06:37,233 --> 01:06:38,233
Ju Won.

1003
01:06:38,233 --> 01:06:39,500
How dare you do this to me!

1004
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:42,933
I'm used to being in charge.
Being the weaker party feels strange.

1005
01:06:42,933 --> 01:06:45,067
What? Ju Won's missing?

1006
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:48,167
If anything happens to Ju Won,
I won't forgive you.
